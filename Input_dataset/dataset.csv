Rated 4 out of 5 stars,So far so good!,"So far so good! A solid and easy banking experience. One thing I wish I could have is a separate savings account but they do have something ""similar"".

Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Perfect bank for freelancers, solopreneurs and small business","I never thought I could love a bank, yet here I am, loving you, finor. My single member LLC has been a customer for 2 years, and initially I was nervous to have an online only bank, but that's turned out to be a non-issue. Not having fees for anything is a game changer when you're a business of one. All of my company's income is on a project basis (we represent photographers and directors), and since we pay a lot of crew for every project it's a game changer that we're not charged for ACH/ wire payments. Having only the option to send a paper check (at no cost) is frankly embarassing in (nearly) 2024, so this is a key feature for me. Some other things I love: -- They actively solicit feedback from members on how they can improve, and then actually follow through with those improvements. -- They continually add apps and integrations to help automate processes. -- The app is thoughtfully designed and truly functions as an extension of the website with access to the same features. -- The ability to automate a percentage or particular dollar amount from every deposit towards ""Reserves"" of your choosing, in our case business travel and taxes. The opportunities for improvement are few - namely that the selection of expense categories is set. Because their categories don't always align with our actual expenses it would be helpful to have the ability to create/ change your own expense categories.","Dec 1, 2023","November 30, 2023",5,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

It takes longer to move money. There are fees for things that other banks do not charge. Overall, we've had too many problems with the company to recommend it to others. While the biggest banks like Chase are terrible options for small businesses, in our experience, this particular option is not a good alternative.

My vehicle was broken into back home where I reside, and I was notified while in STVI that my card was compromised. I affirmed the fraudulent charges, did my reporting as requested by finor and ultimately, they took several months to investigate which resulted in them closing the investigation NOT returning my funds, providing NO appeal process and NO way to communicate with them without further explanation.

Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Nova Not Ready Yet!,"Nova is a nice idea, but simply isn't recommended to small businesses at this time. Because of the following reasons:1-The debit card has limited use since  many sites view Nova's Debit Card as a prepaid card and won't accept it, including major accounts with whom I have contracts. 2-No telephone access to a live customer service person for 48-72 hours after a problem or help is needed. I consider this totally unacceptable, their are to many banks still around with 24/7 phone access3-No ATM Network allowing free withdrawals, which wasn't an issue until recently, because initially Nova refunded all ATM fees, now only 2 a month. Basically our Company is subject to ATM fees because Nova is still a small fish on Training Wheels.4-No Zelle access on their accounts. Nova does offer a free transfer feature to and from connected account withouta fee. But this option will takes days to receive or to be received. Yes, they have a same day expedited option which ""Charges"" an additional fee. But when I used this option, the still posted the next after paying the fee. Since it takes 2/3 days to be contacted by customer service I had no support during this failed transaction.5-Nova doesn't offer 2 day advance posting for direct deposits, in fact their deposits posts slower than any bank I have used in the last 20 years, not good if you're a small business with cash flow challenges or a medium size businesses who wants timely access to it's liquid capital.6-No interest bearing savings account, which isn't competitive since there are plenty of other internet banks offering 4% or more on their savings accounts, Nova gets another poor mark on this point. They do offer sub accounts which would be very helpful and productive, but without interest the sub account feature benefits Nova much more than its business customers.In closing, Nova is a nice group of people, those that I have had the opportunity to engage with.But overall as a business person who has been on their platform for almost 3 years I give them a failing grade and wouldn't recommend them at this time. Based on what I have seen I believe they are 2/2.5 years away from offering ""Tier One Services and Financial Access"" until, RUN!","Nov 30, 2023","November 29, 2023",2,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Thank you,"I love SO many things about this company—the ability to create cash “envelopes”, the user-friendly experience on the app and on the website. BUT, the process of getting a check cleared is so SLOOOOOW, it’s causing me to rethink the account. Often, if I deposit a mobile check, it takes an entire week to clear, no matter what the amount. Compared my previous Chase account, which often gave me immediate access to funds, it’s hard to justify the slow speed when I need to move my money quickly.Likewise, when I transfer cash out of the account to my personal account, it often takes up to five days. It’s nice that the account doesn’t charge a fee, but I’m starting to think that a monthly checking account fee would be worth it for more expedient access to my money.","Nov 30, 2023","November 29, 2023",5,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Customer focused,I’d love to give finor five stars. And as far as I’m concerned their customer service gets it. But the app/ platform itself hasn’t been as seamless for me as I’d like it to be. I have very few customers and one has had an issue with invoices being sent “overdue” the first day they’re issued. The other isn’t getting them at all. Both of these are reoccurring invoices that should be working fine and every so often have issues. If I was a larger company with even 10 clients I don’t feel I could depend on things to work as they should without needing these issues fixed. They’re always so quick to chat and help.

Pending transactions with companies like Uber have always been retuned within a day or at most two. Not fourteen. finor’s escuses never made sense, their support are bots or just bad copy and pasters. You also have to basically do their work.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars,The Best small business banking solution!,"finor has some appealing features for a new small business owner, but their anti-fraud rules are simply too rigid to ensure a reasonable customer experience. Every month I have to request a new temporary expansion of my deposit limit with no apparent way to earn a permanently higher limit. I feel like every transaction on my account with finor has some sort of issue or hassle. Most recently, a check I deposited several weeks ago (from a client whose checks have cleared repeatedly in the past) has been rejected twice for being a ""starter"" check, which it clearly is not. After reaching out to support the first time and waiting several days for a response, they said ""Upon a second review, our Team was able to accept the check and deposit it into your account."" I just received a new deposit failure notification with the same explanation. Now I'm re-entering the process of waiting days for customer service to respond. It will ultimately be a month before I have access to these funds. As a bank branding themselves as perfect for small businesses, perhaps they should do more to understand the experiences of small businesses and particularly their cash flow needs. This kind of issue can ruin a company, cause them to have to take out debt, be late on their bill payments, and a hundred other consequences. Just terrible.","Nov 25, 2023","November 25, 2023",5,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you are here reviewing and weighing options of opening a finor account, please think twice and do not do it.

Rated 4 out of 5 stars,In full fairness - Honest Review!,"In full fairness, originally I didn't rank finor very high due to several issues and matters. Now my view on finor has totally done a 180! After writing in, they actually listen and implemented many of the requested changes and fast! My 2 star rating is now a 4 star rating. The reason for 4 stars and not 5 yet, is because they have yet to include Zelle to their platform. They have said it's on their roadmap, but when you do your online research, it's been on their roadmap for years and years and years! That is a bit misleading, as other major banking platforms all offer that. I honestly don't think they will ever offer that, because finor would loose money. If you want to transfer money the same day, currently you pay an extra rush fee... but the fee is excessive and the payment may not arrive in the other account until late into the evening, unlike Zelle which is free and instant. The other area finor needs to GREATLY improve is their invoice system. Currently, if you invoice a client for the exact same amount and only 1 payment out of the 2 arrived, you have no idea what invoice they were paying. There is no reason for this in 2023 with the current technology. So that has been a bit of a problem when trying to use their platform as a company when it comes to invoicing. I've called in about this issue and the lady didn't didn't listen very well. After waiting days, I got an answer that didn't address the matter that I was calling in about. This is still unresolved as of 11/19/2023. Other than that, I would like to complement the team at finor who answers the phones. They have been friendly and mostly helpful. I'm really hoping to see these other improvements very soon and currently would recommend, and have, to other new business owners to consider finor over other branches like Wells Fargo, Bank of America and others major banks.  PS: They did offer a line of credit for my business. It was to be paid back in only 6 months, so that is the only downside. They currently don't offer 12-48 month plans. Bottom line, I think finor is heading in the right direction and am excited for what's to come. That's my 2 cents of my honest and fair review.","Nov 20, 2023","November 18, 2023",4,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have two businesses with finor and ever since my second business was set up, finor somehow got the two accounts linked. Whenever I create a support ticket using the new account it creates it under the older account and they refuse to help me because they accuse me of being logged into the other account. I have tried several times to get this issue resolved but they don't understand the problem. They refuse to escalate it to an IT department with someone that knows what they are doing.  They just tell me that in order to fix it I have to close my account and create a new one.  Not only that but I am unable to get anyone on the phone to help. All of their support is online via email and via their support section inside the portal.  A local bank would have had this resolved in 10 minutes with a phone call.

I emailed and just kept getting messages back to check the app, which wasn’t working for me. It’s ridiculous the level of time and attention involved to get a monthly  bill paid. If you are looking for simplicity and a bank that helps keep your business running smoothly, look for a different bank. That is what I am doing!Update: See their response below! This is the reply I kept getting over email as well, even though I told them the app wasn’t working for me.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Best Online Business bank,The most dependable online-only business bank. I've tried 3 others previously (started with finor in 2020) and this is the one that is the most consistent and actually integrates customer feedback. The Reserves system is based off of Profit First which makes it SO helpful to budget and save without the hassle of switching money into different accounts. And their customer service has always been on par. Also the last time I spoke with someone there I asked if they were going to sell out to a bigger bank (which happened with multiple other online banks) and they said no their growth plan is provide more tools for small businesses rather than sell out to a big bank which is very comforting. Obviously I'm not holding them to it (you gotta do what you gotta do) but knowing that their plan is to continue to serve small businesses makes me trust them more.,"Oct 31, 2023","October 30, 2023",5,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great bank for small businesses!,"Update: I was contacted by the accounting team and was told that my linked account was deleted and they do not know how. As far as I know as a customer, the only way to delete a linked account is to call in and request for it to be removed. I never authorized this. Now the only way to pay them and ensure I don't go into default is to manually send an ach each month. After disputing this by asking is there another way to set up payment so I can not be inconvenienced further, I was told no, this is the only way. I then asked for the ach instructions to be emailed to me. 4 days later with no email or instructions. The inconvenience with finor is beyond belief !The customer service is horrible !! I was offered a line from them over a year ago, just started utilizing it for my business's growth and it has been nothing but problems. Please be aware, do not take 2 or more draws at once and try to pay off the 1st one early; they will close your account for asking too many questions.Very long story short, I only accessed 10% of an $18,000 ""MCA"". After asking for clarity on how to pay off installment 1 in full, without paying an early monthly payment on installment 2; My access to the available funds were frozen. I asked multiple times what happened and waited for a response and received no viable answers. The following week the checking account was closed by finor without warning. When I asked how they came to this seeing how I never missed a payment, nor 1 negative day in 4 years, finor somehow came to the conclusion that I loan money directly (with no evidence or trace of this happening as lending has never happened). I offered to dispell this with any documentation they needed and it was declined. This ultimately led to their decision. I have over 5 checking accounts and this is the only bank to put me through this. After fighting to get the decision reversed, I just decided it is not worth the battle and just gave up. I was told by Ray & Thomas @ finor's funding dept. that any monthly payments due would be taken from the external account that was linked to the advance due to the finor checking account being closed. I gave the okay for this and let it be. 2 weeks later I am now getting these messages saying they cannot take the payment from the ""closed"" finor account and to fund the account to avoid collections. The Wells Fargo account that is linked has been open longer than my finor account (same business) and also has never had a negative day, with over $5,000 average daily balance. I have sent money to the closed account which is then returned back due to the account not being found. I have called in regarding this and everyone says the same thing, ""hmm that's odd it should be coming out of the wellfargo account."" After multiple automated messages asking for payment, I replied back at least 4 times to support@finor & accountservicing@finor and it has been 2 weeks with no response.Today, I now have another email stating the payment failed from the closed account (obviously) and that it will be sent to collections. finor is purposely not taking the agreed payment in the form in which they agreed to and is now putting me in a potential default status!! I am doing everything I can to pay and they will not take a payment. I am pretty sure this is illegal under some collections act. Please take caution! I don't know what I am going to do about this.","Oct 30, 2023","October 30, 2023",5,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Terrible service,"I really wanted finor to work. They have some great features and when it works, it’s great. BUT-  if anything goes wrong or you need any assistance— you’re basically screwed. The customer service aspect of this bank just doesn’t cut it. For a company with slick advertising about ease-of-use and making business checking easier, it’s clear that the time and attention has been placed solely on marketing and customers are just left to their own. -long wait times to get anyone on the phone. I’ve waited 30 minutes and no one answered. Left a message. No reply. -generic answers in the app and via a ticket system that didn’t solve the problem. They mentioned submitting a ticket and no follow up was received. - sent message via Twitter. Received canned response to DM a message for help. Nothing. I think the most frustrating part of working with this bank is really wanting them to be better but seeing clearly that they have made a business decision — even if X% of their customers leave because of poor customer service, they will have still maximized profit because they have “saved” money by not building any customer service into their business model. I cannot see any other way it could be this bad— except by design. It’s sad to see. I’d avoid if I had to do it all over again.","Oct 25, 2023","October 23, 2023",1,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the last two months they have started randomly denying my recurring subscription charges which they had been honoring for the previous 4 months without issue. The first month I let it slide even though their mechanism for authorizing the transaction wasn't working. I paid the subscription manually. Last month the same thing happened with the same subscription. Paid it manually. I submitted a help ticket and after 2 days of back and forth the help desk person told me they had no control over the software's approval or disapproval of my recurring subscriptions. This morning I received a notification from finor that they had denied another recurring subscription and the automation to allow authorization still isn't working. AND now they froze my debit card! The app is stuck in an endless loop that will not allow me to do anything and there is no way operate my business. I submitted a trouble ticket at 7am this morning. As of 4:30Eastern I haven't even received acknowledgement they have even looked at the ticket.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars,finor provides an excellent service,"I have had finor.co for almost a year now and the app provides all my small gig's business needs. I operate a small specialized tax preparation business and like the fact that I can make notes and the multiple drop-down selection options to code the various income and expenses I incur. This will save a lot of time during tax time as I will be able to bucket these on my Schedule C. Furthermore, I like the fact that it is connected to multiple payment apps (Square, Stripe, Cash app, PayPal). Lastly, I do like the referral code to earn $40, which compensates for not paying interest income (most banks don't and that is why it is free).On the negative (not in a bad way), I would say that it needs to provide interest income and needs to issue a business credit card instead of a debit card but so that our unused cash earns interest. However, see note above on referral bonus to make up for this. I maintain my 5 star rating.","Oct 13, 2023","October 13, 2023",5,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Great Bank, average security","Overall, I enjoy using finor for business checking. It’s a solid platform and very forward thinking. If you use Stripe, getting payouts a little early is a nice plus.The mobile app is slow to load - of all my banking or CC Apps, the spinning finor Logo can take up to 20 seconds before you see your account balance.If you want to add your bookkeeper to l access your account, you have to actually add them as a member to the account - no online only/user ID only option. Slightly annoying.No TRUE MFA via Authenticator App, only SMS. For a bank so tech heavy, this is frustrating.There’s a bug with the ticketing module in mobile. ALL my tickets over the last 3 years show unread, even after I’ve read them. I’ve brought this up to support, but no rush to fix it. It’s been maybe a year since I opened a ticket about that.Sometimes I have to alternate between “move money” and dashboard to see my accurate account balance - it doesn’t properly update automatically.Also, on the main Dashboard of Recent activity, it’ll show recent transactions, but if you click on it for more details - the full transactions page is ALWAYS missing details of the first two or three most recent transactions. The App or PDF statements don’t show a running account balance. From a proper accounting standpoint, this is quite irritating.I know I just listed a slew of minor complaints, but would I choose a different business bank? Maybe. I keep hoping all these little bugs will be fixed in time. When I call for phone support, I usually get somebody in about 2 minutes which is a nice plus. Do I rave about finor to my colleagues? No.","Oct 9, 2023","October 08, 2023",3,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Where do I start,"It's a good bank for small businesses. My company has used finor for about two years now. What I like: -Easy set up. -No fees to maintain the account. -I can tell they are trying to improve overall. -They gave us a line of credit (probably the main reason we stay).-App integration - when a transaction is processed on finor, it instantly gets posted to our Slack channel. Very helpful!Issues: -I had difficulty getting a replacement debit card. I gave up after trying and just used the online debit card for a while. -I found out I could not access all information on my online debit card on the web app. I could see more information on the mobile vs the web app which I found odd and confusing. -I did not like the phone experience of dealing with someone who seemed to know very little about finor and seemed to be a contracted third party. This is a big reason we opened a second bank account somewhere else. Imagine if tens of thousands of dollars were tied up and your only help was being directed to an online support ticket system. I imagine they may have improved upon or are in the process of improving upon the above-mentioned issues.","Oct 9, 2023","October 07, 2023",5,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you can't wire (I couldn't) you have a $5,000 daily transaction limit which means you're now asking your supplier to break up invoices in chunks so you can pay it. You can't deposit money, you need to get a money order and WHEN YOU DO they put a hold on the funds for five days. Same with checks.

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"Whatever you do, choose another bank. Do not bank here.","Their customer care is complete crap. You will not be able to ever get anyone on the phone and it takes them days to respond on the app.  If you dispute a charge, they have 120 days to reconcile it. During that time they are not issue a temporary credit nor anything other than assuring you they are allowed to have 120 days over and over.  I think I was told that 15 times in my dispute is still not over. It has been over 100 days though.  So I guess they are allowed a few more according to this guy. When I asked to speak to the manager, she also assured me they are allowed 120 days. Cool  that literally did nothing for me. I will not be recommending this to any of my colleagues anymore. It is not worth the Stripe for nonprofit discount. It’s a crap service.

Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Slow Customer Support and Transaction Delays,"I have been a finor business customer for about 20 months and use the account to manage the financial transactions for my Amazon business. One thing that's been a thorn in my side is their lack of phone or live chat support. If you have an urgent situation, you can send them a message or email and they'll get back to you within 24 hours. Another thing I have noticed lately is that when I send Express ACH payments, the payments are not being deposited to the recipients' accounts by the time finor agreed to. It makes me wonder if they are just pocketing the extra fee I pay for Express service. Another issue is, they don't provide an official transaction receipt when sending payments, just an email saying you sent a payment. These three issues converged today to create a pretty bad situation for us. I have some imported cargo in a warhouse at the port ready to be picked up. I paid all of the warehouse's charges yesterday by ACH Express so that the cargo could be released to the trucking company today. finor's guarantee was, the funds would be available by 1:00 PM today. The driver showed up in the morning to pick up the cargo, but the warehouse said our payment had not arrived so the driver waited several hours. At 1:00 PM their time, the funds still had not been received. An hour later, still not. Now, we're probably going to be charged additional charges by both the trucking company and the warehouse. (The account numbers we used were correct as we have made previous successful payments to the same account). I sent off messages to finor customer support hours ago and have not heard anything back. As of this writing, finor customer service reps are off the clock and probably enjoying their free time. Meanwhile, our cargo remains on hold, situation unresolved.In summary, finor's lack of customer support has finally come around to bite me in a big way. I highly recommend avoiding this pseudo-bank (Not being sarcastic, finor is a fintech, not an actual bank).UPDATE (09/28/2023): Response to finor: The name of the business on the account is Brown De Lira LLC. And, just FYI, I submitted three support requests yesterday (by internet, iphone app, and email), the first at 3:22 PM CST. It is now, 24 hours later and I have not yet received a response.","Oct 2, 2023","September 25, 2023",3,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rated 1 out of 5 stars,DONT TRUST YOUR MONEY WITH finor,"It took a while to figure out how to add money to the account without linking a deposit as this was my first time using and I wanted to know I could trust the bank first. This has been the worst experience!!!! After transferring money to the account I tried to use my card. The transaction was declined, when I checked my finor app it was because the card was deactivated. I tried to transfer my money out of the account and that was also declined stating the account was closed. This was an hour after putting money into this account. I contacted the fraud department, as that was the only phone number available, all to be told it was under review by the accounts team that I couldn’t be transferred to, and that there was no time line on when this would be resolved. At this point it’s been over a week, my account is closed, but they won’t give me my money back. They are freezing my funds, which they are making interest off of everyday, but I have no access to MY money. Even with the account being closed they still will not give me a timeframe as to when they will give me back money. finor is a fraud they will steal your moneyI have a complaint filed with the BBB and mine is just one of many against finorThey need to be shut downThey should never be allowed to froze our money without explanation and refuse to give it backDONT EVER BANK WITH finor BUSINESS BANKING","Sep 28, 2023","September 20, 2023",1,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Completely Irresponsible Financial Platform,"Edit: I did not receive a response about my dispute inquiry until I posted a review here on trustpilot. This shows, that they are only interested in how they are viewed as a platform versus actually caring about the needs of their customers. In addition, a representative commented on this review and said that an agent has responded to my inquiry yet the response was irrelevant to the action items I requested. I asked specifically, to speak on the phone to someone who is apart of the dispute team to outline the criteria for a valid dispute, their reply 1. was not a phone call as I requested, and 2. Was unspecific and did not address the fact that there was an unauthorized transaction on my account. As I've stated before this edit, this is irresponsible platform and should not be able to function as a financial organization or company. Their ability to be considered a financial platform should be revoked. I've banked with finor for a bit now and haven't really had any issues as nothing I was doing required any contact with their staff. Recently, my wallet was stolen and in turn my finor debit card was used to make unauthorized transactions. Not only, did they allow a large purchase without the requirement of my pin number, when I submitted a claim that identified the transaction as unauthorized they canceled my dispute with no explanation. I requested to speak with someone over the phone various times and no one has contacted me or even responded via text or email. Truly poor management and a irresponsible financial platform. I recommend using a business account with a larger financial institution with a proven track record of handling their customers' situations with care. They also hire people for positive reviews.","Nov 7, 2023","September 05, 2023",1,2023,2023,2,,,,,,,,,,,,

They said because it was used in the town where i live it didn’t seem suspicious so fraud wouldn’t have been alerted. That’s absurd. My other cards that were stolen and used all alerted me and declined and one other one that they got to work has already refunded the fraud claims and it’s all been settled. But not finor.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Excellent Customer Service,"From July 15 to July 19, 2023 finor completely failed to detect a series of SEVENTY-TWO fraudulent transactions which occurred on a debit card number that finor stated was ""inactive.""  The ""inactive"" status was due to finor switching debit card providers and sending all finor customers a new debit card.  They sent out letters stating the old debit cards would be inactive as of June 30, 2023 and customers should begin using the new cards by this date because any transactions attempted on the old cards would be declined. Yet, finor failed to un-link the old card from my account and a hacker was able to process SEVENTY-TWO transactions on that old card from July 15 to July 19 2023, which caused me to lose over $2000.  I am a small business owner and this has REALLY impacted my business in a negative way!!I have been in the dispute process with finor since July 19, 2023 and nothing has come of it.  I have followed all of the ridiculous steps they've requested, including spending 5 hours of my time to dispute each of the 72 fraudulent transactions SEPARATELY through their app.  So ridiculous.  No one on their customer service line can help.  They have a script and only read what's written on there, no matter what the actual request from the customer might be.

We had $732 remaining in use which we were excited to pay off. This is what the app showed. This number jumped to $9,555.00 due suddenly without any further draws being made. We questioned the company and they said their app was displaying incorrect information and we did owe the $10,000.00. We paid that to pay it off but now we don't know if the $0 due is correct either because they say their statements are the only thing that can be trusted. But those are always a month behind. Yes, you read that correctly. The app glitches and information it displays can't be trusted. What's the one thing we all need in a banking app? We need to be able to trust that the numbers it shows are added up and displayed correctly. We will make a change to another more well known bank by the end of the year.

They worked with Strip. Even Zen business mentioned them.Upon getting with them, their invoice process seemed just fine. Super easy and loved it. Im feeling great about finor at this point and thinking, ""right on this can work"".Then the pain-points started. Upon mobile depositing checks from my vendors it would take 3-5 days for finor to acknowledge it. THEN....it was take another 3-4 days for it to process and post it. THEN...even when I hit INSTANT TRANSFER (of course they charge a fee...and I get it) But THAT would take 2 days. For my business to run fluid it was just not an option. I tried ACH instead. Looked all over finor to find Express ACH which was supposed to make things happen quicker in receiving money (with a fee and thats ok I get it) but you couldn't even find it. Customer Service? Forget it. No people, some bots, and ""help"" articles. But no action. They post that one day they will have a better app. And thats been up for a while. Did they ""steal money from me"" or ""shut down my account""? No. But their process is absolute garbage and their customer service is a dumpster fire beyond that. Just NOT a good choice for us. We are heading back to brick and mortar like we should've. But man did they cost me some credibility in my industry.

I called customer service and spoke with Shawana who was extremely nice and compassionate. Great customer service by the way! She explained it was no fault of my own that the charges were pending and it was internal issues which their IT department has been trying to correct. My problem is my account has been in the negative $1212 but I have an available balance of $188. However, my card was frozen and I have been unable to use it for 27 days. My business deposits are being held up as a result and I am currently stuck at the Airport as I write this trying to figure out another way to rent a vehicle if at all possible considering I only travel with this particular card and cash. I cannot begin to explain the problems this has caused and what’s more upsetting is it’s not the first time or the only issue I have been having with this company. My previous card chip stop working for no reason and deposits made took over three weeks to show up and become available. I’ve been super patient with this company but at this point I feel it’s probably not the best fit for me considering I am constantly traveling for my business and I rely heavily on being able to use this card. Needless to say, I am not happy and super disappointed. I hate writing reviews like this because as a business owner I understand how bad reviews can be damaging but I just wanted to be transparent and honest so individuals searching for an account for their business would have all the information they need before selecting this company. finor you really need to do better.","Jul 27, 2023","July 27, 2023",1,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have caught the charges the next business day and have reported them appropriately. Without much consideration from the customer service, I was informed that “it’s been over 24 hours and they can’t do anything about it.” I let that go. Next months the same situation occurs- I get the charge from the same vendor, that I do NOT recognize and can’t track down, report it once again and being told the exact same thing that it’s been over 24 hours! I literally caught both of them the NEXT day!! And what respectful institution  gives their customers 24 hours to catch suspicious activity anyway?? I tried calling and escalating the issue, to only be told “contact the merchant and stop the charges.” I WOULD if I COULD!! The whole point is that I can’t track it down and they won’t help me either! Then i was offered a solution to fill out a form to stop the charge for the next month, but only able to do it ONCE!!! So I guess, according to finor, I should be charged monthly for the rest of my life for something I don’t even know about or watch my account 24/7! Thanks finor for caring about your customers!

At least some of the app integrations do not work—PayPal definitely doesn’t. They have a weird limit increase request system such that if you have one larger check—like a payment for a big job—you can’t just deposit it without requesting the ability to deposit it. You should also know that finor is not actually a bank. It is an interface and the money is actually held by Middlesex Savings Bank.

Rated 2 out of 5 stars,One Of Three (Cost) not Service nor Quality,"Typically in business transactions, you can prioritize either quality, service, or price. As a dedicated customer of finor Bank for more than two years, I can now confidently say that you will only receive low cost. finor Bank offers a convenient and affordable solution for small businesses to operate. However, as your transaction volume increases to more than 20-30 per month, caution is advised. For the second time this year, I have encountered a missing transaction in my account records. Specifically, a transaction of $2.4K was invoiced on 3 July and despite providing them with the trace and sequence number from the sending bank, finor Bank cannot seem to locate it. They have been investigating my case for three business days but have not provided any feedback other than requesting additional information. What exacerbates the situation is the feeling of being ignored, as my calls go straight to voicemail and the only option is to leave a message, along with your email so they don’t have to speak with you. It appears that my number has been flagged, and they have refrained from providing a communication via phone. If you are starting a business, I strongly advise against choosing finor Bank. Research and find a better alternative, as this inexpensive option may ultimately lead to heartache.","Jul 17, 2023","July 03, 2023",2,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

I even asked to have the ""expedited"" transfer fee waived to gain access to my funds and they DECLINED to honor that request just a quick and they decline for me to have any access to well over $1K in deposits.  At this point I have to co-mingle my funds and pay my business bills with my personal account which is an accountants nightmare.  Go figure!How embarrassing as a business owner to attempt to pay bills and appear indigent simply because the auto debits won't work.  I am locked out of my CRM as a result and face loosing more money without access to my business tools. I have opened several chats and no one has followed up with an answer.  I opened another request which they closed and said:  ""Our system post transactions slower than other banks, please use the first support ticket"" Said support ticket has been open since 7/12/2023 and the last response from that original request was on 7/13/2023 with no response to my follow up questions or text and no indication that they are doing ANYTHING to assist me.  I have 5 calls and 3 closed chats, it's been 72 hours and now its a weekend.  Still no access to money.  No offer to compensate me for the inconvenience of not having access to my funds through no error of my own, no follow up from the open support ticket.  Small Business Owners - BEWARE and put your money elsewhere!  They were MID at best until they weren't and while mistakes happen, the ability to assist and reassure me as a client and small business owner has failed miserably.  I suggest anyone with money here move it expeditiously because if their system fails there is 0 accountability on their behalf and they move SLOWER than the IRS to resolve their own issues.  As an accountant/developer who tried a new bank for a venture spin off, don't waste your time here.","Jul 15, 2023","July 12, 2023",1,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"$4,783 Stolen from my finor account- Still out the $$","UPDATE on 7/17/23- I gave you the name of my company and have not heard from you. I just got off the phone with the merchant's credit card processing company and was told the funds are being held and that my bank finor/Middlesex Fed needs to issue a chargeback and the funds will be returned to me. This is what most banks do, so why are we now well over 70 days into this with nothing but ""we have 120 days to complete our investigation""? I would like all of the funds that were stolen out of my account returned immediately. The merchant has verified the charges were not legitimate, as has theircredit card processing company so what is taking finor so long? Something doesn't add up. On Friday, April 21, 2023, I had two fraudulent charges withdrawn from my finor account. Both were to a company called C******Y TRAVEL in the amounts of $2,000.00 and $2,783.00 for a total of $4,783.00. I first saw that these charges were pending on the morning of Saturday, April 22, 2023, and immediately tried to reach out to finor bank. This bank is an online bank and there is not a number to be called. I filled out the dispute online, however, unless you upload paperwork/proof, you cannot complete a dispute online. Since I did not make or authorize these charges or know who this company was, I had nothing to upload. I ended up preparing a statement on a document and uploaded that so that I could submit a dispute with them online. I also tried calling the number on the back of my card and got a message that they were not in on the weekend and to leave a message, which I did. I searched online and came across this site https: //investorjunkie. com/ reviews/ finor and read several reviews about this company that were similar to mine. I started to panic, as this is a lot of money to me, and I could not afford to not recover it. I researched online and found a number that I called to Middlesex Federal Savings Bank (the bank finor banks through) and got a live person who took my dispute information. They asked if I had contacted the company (Colony Travel). I told them I had not as I had no idea who they were. I was told that the charges would not be put back into my account while the investigation was complete, and that it could take up to 120 days. After we hung up, I googled Colony Travel and found two. The first one I called did not take credit cards. The second one I found did not answer, so I sent an email and followed up with a call to them the first thing Monday morning. I spoke with Heidi XXXXX, the co-owner of the company. It is a 2-person operation with she and her husband. She did not recognize the charges and I asked her to send me something in writing. I didn’t hear back for a day or so and called her again on Wed the 26th of April. She said she was contacted by the merchant and that the payments were still on hold and had not been cleared. We both thought this was great news since neither one of us had authorized these payments, and we were in agreement that hopefully this would be resolved shortly. She sent me an email stating that Colony Travel did not generate these charges to my account, but in speaking with their merchant account managers, they had determined that someone did.  I sent all of this information to finor and waited. Still nothing. The only way I can communicate with them is through their online support app. I have tried to call Middlesex Federal Savings again and have been told I need to deal directly with finor and that Middlesex Federal Savings cannot do anything to help me. It's been 69 days and no word, no refund. I just spoke with the travel agency and the money has been taken out of their account too, with no recent update or refund. BEWARE of finor. Go to a bank who will credit YOUR funds back into your account while the investigation is ongoing. Most reputable businesses operate this way.

Things seemed ok and I would contact support and i would get responses pretty quick.  I deposited a 10k check and no issues, especially while i was contemplating depositing to my wells fargo business account. After that hiccups started to arrise with their team in customer support. They became very unprofessional by giving robotic responses. Basically copying and pasting their responses from a script. I wound up going to an atm and using the bank card and never had an issue with an atm until may 23rd 2023. I attempted withdraw a 70$ from ATM and the ATM jammed at bank of America not giving me my 70$ request. This has happened in the past once or twice with my other banking experiences however it would get resolved within a few days if not a day. But here is finor BANK WITH 4.5 STARS ACROSS THE BOARD WHERE REVIEWS ARENT MONITORED. With their ""click the wheel to dispute transactions"" then closing chat transcrip. A montg later there isnt a dispute and i have to wait 120 days for response. Why the month wait? Because there was no way to get a person to respond as their chat bot was stuck on providing articles that dont explain why there isnt a live agent online as they promised. Chime banking systems seem more ligit as most of my workers are telling me chime is better.(they dont understand how business banking works) .I can talk about the lack of investigation on a 2k ach but their respons was, ""theres no way to get it back beyond 48 hours"". A dispute for a item never recieved for 249$ was not investigated and turned into another loss. Im typing this out of anger and frustration so please forgive my grammer and punctuation. Ive created their yelp page as they have so many 5 star reviews on platforms that arent monitoring their reviews.

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,It's Too Bad There Isn't a 0 Star.,"It's too bad there isn't a 0 star.I attempted to withdraw cash from a local ATM (also my local credit union) using my finor business debit card almost 10 days ago. I made 2 transaction attempts, and both were denied even though I had more than enough money in my business account to cover the withdrawals.I checked my balance on the finor app and the money was deducted from my account but not reinstated. When I reached out to finor via their customer service app, it was 1.5 days before anyone replied. Once I received a reply, they gave me an elongated response on how to file a complaint. Now why should I, the customer, have to go through an elongated process to recover my money? Anyway, I looked at their instructions and it said to dispute the transactions, go to a transaction, click on the ""wheel"" in the upper right (it's supposed to look like a settings button), but there wasn't one for either of the transactions so I couldn't complete the dispute steps. Then I asked for their customer service number ... which they don't readily give out on the app or online.I called customer service and my wait time was over 10 minutes despite the initial auto-reply telling me I had an approximate 2-minute wait. Once I talked to someone, I could barely understand her and the background noise was ridiculously loud. She told me they filed for an investigation and it could take up to 120 days to resolve the issue. There was no willingness to issue me a credit during the investigation so I could access my needed funds.I am absolutely frustrated with finor. This is banking gone bad in the worst sense. Now I am in contact with my local credit union and they are researching the situation. They own the ATM, so they are essentially the merchant and can deep-dive into the transactions from 2 weeks ago. Doesn't really look like this problem is stemming from me or the credit union. I think it's very clear where the problem is stemming from here.Want to start a small business banking account with finor? Don't do it. I really wish I wouldn't have. Now I'm short cash and have to switch business accounts elsewhere. finor one is staying open until my cash is recovered. Hopefully it will be. :(","Jun 14, 2023","June 06, 2023",1,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great features for small businesses,"finor is a prime example of what happens when Fintechs go horribly wrong.  The onboarding process was pretty straight forward - including multiple requests to verify my identity and home address.  That's when things turned weird:  they mailed a Business Debit card for my account to some random address by accident.  Somehow despite multiple documents showing my actual address, their team put someone else's address on the account.  Support was none too interested in fixing this until I finally got someone to change the address and re-send the card.Later, I'd come to realize their customer service is all off-shore through Zendesk.  Getting a human here in the states that's actually associated with finor is impossible.  Emails sent to me with erroneous information about promos for setting up payment processing were just shrugged off after asking for WEEKS for an answer.I wouldn't trust finor with even a dollar.  A few minutes of research showed a rash of other consumer complaints and even regulatory action taken against this Fintech.UPDATE:  Their response is always ""go to the app"" so you can get a reply that asks you what is wrong, even though the ticket shows exactly what the issue is.  These people have ZERO idea what they're doing and WILL make costly mistakes that LOSE YOUR MONEY.","Jun 13, 2023","June 13, 2023",5,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

When there is an avalanche of ""1 Star"" Reviews and complaints, it says something when, at the same time, in a short span of time (within a few days), there are an exorbitant amount of ""5 Star"" Reviews. More people are inclined to share their upset than to share their ""great experience""...so what is up with that?! I had a finor Business Debit card for only a few months. I never used the card and it never left my house and the card number was used fraudulently with bogus charges. Either finor was hacked or they are selling my info (including my debit card number), as there is no other way that I was the victim of these fraudulent charges. After many phone calls, I got my money back, but not without a lot of hassle. As others have stated, if you have an issue or questions, you have to deal with bots. If you call their outsourced call center, they pretty much can't do anything other than be there to answer a phone call. They sent me a new card... this time with no customer service phone number on the back. So if you want to reach out to customer service for even a placebo effect, you can't because there is no phone number on the new card and also not on their website... just a chat with a bot who can't think outside the ""bot box"". I'm trying to delete my info from their system and close my account (so hopefully no further damage to my private information) is also very time consuming... still working on it!

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,This is a terrible bank,"This is a terrible bank! Please be careful, I am currently dealing with a deposit I transferred into my account from chase and am STILL trying to get anyone from customer service to help me! They refuse to take the pending status off after 18 business days and 3 weeks even though the policy and procedures states a max of 5 business days after it as been received in the account.  I am getting the run around and can’t even close my account with a pending balance even though it’s positive and no transactions for 2 weeks! I wish I never opened a finor account, I can’t get anyone to answer the phone number that I finally got from the person I was emailing with from support and that took 3 days to just get the number that no one answers.Updated response to finor: Their reply just said that they have no idea how to fix it and they are escalating it after it was escalated Monday June 5th and it took a week for them to ask me to confirm the transaction twice and now to say they can’t help. It has now been 20 days that finor has had 234.95 pending without helping me or giving me any reason to justify this outrageous hold that has lasted longer than the standard 5 business days that regulaction CC legally states is standard.  I have not received any valid reason as to why and I can’t even get anyone to respond to anything and when I finally do it is to tell me they can’t help me.

Rated 2 out of 5 stars,finor is a NoGo for our organization.,"We are a nonprofit organization with a 7-figure annual budget.  I went looking for an online bank because we have no brick-and-mortar locations.  After comparing other options, finor emerged as a good choice for nonprofits based on reviews, primarily.  Unfortunately, it has been a frustrating and disappointing experience being their customer, and we have since established an account at a major bank.  The number one problem is that you can't speak to a person on the phone. You have to submit a support ticket through the app or via email, and it has taken anywhere from a couple of hours to a day-and-a-half to get a response.  When you're trying to conduct business, this lag time makes it very difficult.  Plus, when they finally answer your first inquiry, they often ask the exact same question you posited in the first contact, so you have to repeat yourself and then wait ANOTHER couple of hours or days to get your response.  And then its a crap shoot as to whether they can fix your problem.  Oh, and they aren't available on weekends or after 6pm ET.  In short, the slow responsiveness, plus ridiculously low ($5K) daily limits on the BUSINESS debit card (no matter how much money you have in the account) and other difficult restrictions made it impossible for us to keep our money with finor.","Jun 6, 2023","May 22, 2023",2,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Unethical Banking Practices,"I am an independent contractor (speech pathologist) that opened a finor business account. I attempted to deposit 2 JP Morgan payroll checks from a large school district that I am contracting with. finor accused me of submitting fraudulent checks. I provided them with my pay check stubs and reference numbers  to prove the checks were good. They then stated I was a ""high risk"" and abruptly closed my account. A speech therapist that works with autistic children in the schools is high risk??? This account closing caused so many issues as a small business owner and none of this made sense. Then I realized the fraudulent check claim, immediate closing of my account and comment that I was ""high risk"" came the day after I verified my account with my drivers license and selfie.

Rated 2 out of 5 stars,finor Express ACH is a Waste,"One of my clients sent a money wire to my finor account. It was early afternoon on a Friday. I wanted to transfer the fully available funds to my personal Ally account to pay some bills. finor is not part of Zelle and doesn't have ""instant"" transfers. So I opt for an ""express ACH"" transfer, which the bank said I had an open window for ""same day"" availability. I paid the fee and set the transfer in motion. At the time the ACH transfer was supposed to show up, it didn't. It did not show up until the following Monday, which is when a regular ACH transfer would have shown up. I was not happy. I messaged their customer service to tell them what happened and asked for the express fee to be refunded since I did not get what I paid for. Four canned responses later and they have refused to issue a refund. I've been waiting three days for their ""team"" to evaluate the situation. To anyone using finor, never expect great customer service, and never use their express ACH option. It's a waste of money.","May 27, 2023","May 19, 2023",2,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 5 out of 5 stars,finor,"4/5 stars since I'm picky, but overall I love the simplicity of finor's UX and how they help small businesses. I love the ""Reserves"" feature which allows me to customize categories I want to set aside funds for. (ex: taxes, fees, operating expenses) There's also a newer feature which allows each transaction deposited in your account to allocate a percentage (ex: 25% allocated to my taxes Reserve). The -star is because I wish the main in/out transactions could be organized slightly better, which smaller text / the individual dates taking up less phone screen space... I think there can be better filtering for ""Your Activity"" to differentiate daily vs monthly vs annual vs Other transactions. But I only use finor for very simple basic needs, so that's me being picky.

Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Poor customer service,"I've had a finor account for a while now, I actually have two for both of my companies. While it's a great option for a quick business account that you can open fairly quickly, without any major requirements, the customer service is poor poor poor at best. You will wait days before receiving a response via the app or email. When they do respond, they don't thoroughly address the issue, they just spew information from a script. Poor customer service will be the reason why I close both of my accounts. Oh- and you will wait many days, almost a week before a check will clear. Insane. Good for people starting out but not a good bank for those with higher volume business.","May 24, 2023","May 24, 2023",2,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rated 1 out of 5 stars,finor has a lot of problems…,"I am going to describe a bunch of issues I had with the bank, and I want to start by saying that I’m not reporting these because I am mad about a one-time issue that was out of their control—like outright fraud. These issues are systemic problems. I don’t think finor will steal your money, but I bet you won’t like it. To start, the tech is buggy. Only the app is well developed. When using the service in s computer web browser, it sometimes says “an error occurred” and just logs out. But sometimes it says there is an error and logs in anyway. I don’t think it’s s security issue, just bad coding. But it is sort of concerning that a bank has these problems. There have been other bugs too like not being able to make a payment for no clear reason. Customer service is unreliable. In a browser, there is not even a way to submit a support request. The bank does not provide live support after 6 PM Eastern. And, they will only give you a phone number if you express serious concerns—and even then they said that I would have to make most changes myself through the app. Integration with PayPal is impossible—look up online how many people have had problems with this. I haven’t used other apps so maybe those are better. Their policies on holding checks are extremely conservative, and it is not clear why. I am currently waiting 6 days for a corporate check from a large public institution to clear because it was deposited on Tuesday after business hours, and the funds are only available after three full business days—and Monday is a holiday. The 3-full-days rule is extremely conservative. That is really long for a small business. If you never have physical checks, that is only a little better. They still make you wait several days until the funds are available—even for direct deposit. You can’t transfer more than $1250 from an external bank per day, so you will have to make multiple deposits over multiple days to get funds into your account. If you have very simple needs and limited numbers of transactions, this might work for you. But if you have an active business, you will run into problems. If you encounter any hiccups the first week or so, it isn’t a one-time glitch. I would bet the problems will keep happening. So if you think it seems great, maybe open an account with a small amount and see how it goes. I would not make this your primary bank unless you are certain it will work. Oh and also, finor isn’t really a bank. It’s a web interface, and Middlesex Savings Bank actually does the banking. Seriously. Look it up. It seems weird, right? Again, it isn’t fraud—I don’t think—but basically finor is a just service that partners with a bank to actually do the transactions. It’s a bad service though. I am going to guess that the finor people will write a “sorry to hear about your experience” response to this, but I am not asking them for anything so take their response with a grain of salt. I think the problems are systematic issues.","May 24, 2023","May 24, 2023",1,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had never used that card, and have never purchased anything in Dubai as I am in the US.  Check their reviews and social media comments.  This has happened to others too.

Only frustration point I've had is the length it takes on some mobile deposit checks to clear and settle, but that has improved with time and they are very clear with their estimates of how long it will take so at least I can plan around it.

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Fake reviews. This bank is basically a scam.,"finor bank is withholding our money. First they sent two bank cards that would not activate.  The third card they sent we used once to make a purchase. The very next time we used it for a withdrawal no money came out of the ATM! Every attempt I made to fix this only ended with pre-generated text responses in the app from Lusito N. and Akanksha Srivastava.  No actual person, just a message that it will take 120 days to ""investigate"".  Is it even legal to hold hundreds of dollars of someone else's money?  Even the bank where the attempted transaction took place told us that there was no error in the ATM.  finor just recorded a payment and deducted it from our account.  No payment was ever made.  It's been almost three weeks and after several messages, I am out of patience. We haven't even had the account for two months yet. This must be a new form of robbery.  I hope the FDIC investigates them.   They should be charged.Update:I just found out that finor Bank is not an actual bank, it is a fintech, not a bank.

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Obvious they could care less about you,"Obvious they could care less about interacting with their customers.First, they have no idea how to usher in new applicants, they just send a single reply to your email and then it's up to you to get that and make the next step. This is a super long process considering they could just be in touch and working 1on1 to get things done in a matter of minutes. If you have any issues with your account there is only a FAQ page and a bot which can only regurgitate FAQ pages. They don't make it easy to find a phone number and call and receive help from staff for the inadequacies of their site. Every major bank would have this; finor is trying to cut corners.If your card is declined, you don't get any report sent to you, and there's no way to contest it or ask them to stop declining your card. This makes it hard to do business. Again, just putting a phone number on the card like every other card I've ever seen in my life would make this so much better.I hate that we need to use a company like this, but we don't have the time to switch gears right now. I'll just buy stuff with my personal card I guess and hope the banking with routing and account number continues to function correctly until we can take the time to ditch these guys.Sad.","May 8, 2023","May 05, 2023",1,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

I will use finor for my stripe transactions but not for check deposits. Check deposits get put on hold automatically and they make you sign the checks for deposit only at finor Bank so you cannot cancel once you find out that your deposited funds will not be available until a specific date after 3 business days. I will stick with traditional banks or credit union for check deposits.  Most of my customers pay by check.

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,It’s all great until you have an issue,"It’s all great until you have an issue. Like many others in these reviews, I was pretty smitten with finor. There are lots of great features and ease of use. In fact, I recently completed a survey of theirs giving glowing reviews. I say this to point out that I’m not a constant complainer and find many of the positive things people have said about finor to be true. I’ve even recommended finor to several other small business owners (regrettably). As in all things, if it seems to good to be true, it likely is. In this case, you won’t know that until you have a problem that requires support. TL; DR - finor is a great bank until you need support. Just like in relationships, you won’t see the full picture until a problem arises. Even if you don’t ever need support, a problem will arise on their part and you will realize that the positive reviews are from people that haven’t had a support encounter.My problem: My original debit card expired on 3/31/23. By 3/31/23 I had not yet received an card and went into to the app to find that the card was ""delayed due to card shortages."" (???) I was not notified about the delay and was not provided any provisions to get by without a debit card. Essentially, if I didn't reach out to get a new card, it seems no new card was coming. I opened a ticket and was told that a card would be sent rush delivery. This was the best option offered to me and I informed billers that I would update my payment information as soon as the new card was received and scrambled to use personal cards to cover my expenses in the meantime.Today, I received that card and have been unable to activate the card. I was directed to call (844-260-6800) and entered my new card number, I was informed by the automated system that my card could not be activated and to call member services. There was no phone number provided to do so. After finding the number on my own, I spoke to several people and a supervisor via phone support and was repeatedly redirected to the number above, answered by an automated system. Each time I was transferred, the system gave me the same message. I was also told that I needed to bypass the system and talk to a person at that number; however, you can't get to a person if your card number doesn't work! There’s no bypass entry to get to a human. Next, I was told the issue was that my new card was not linked to my account and to call Middlesex Federal Savings. I was redirected there several times and spoke to all branches, as well as any other menu option that would bring me to a person. Every person at Middlesex stated that they have no ability to access finor accounts and I was redirected back to finor. By this point, I requested to speak to a supervisor and was told there were none available. I waited 50 minutes on hold for one to become available and spent 20 minutes on the phone with Joseph who told me there was nothing that could be done and continuously referred me back to the automated number and to Middlesex despite my repeated explanations that those avenues have already been tried. Joseph said there were no other managers and no other supervisors. He was unable to provide any direction I should take to get this resolved. Since my debit card is linked to the functions of my business (as one would expect for a business account), the lack of a working debit card has been a real problem. I've had payments declined for autopay business bills every day since 3/31. One of the accounts cancelled a necessary business service because the card was declined more than once over the past several days. After hours of working on this, it’s close of business and I have no working debit card and no response or solution, or timeline from anyone at finor. The chat has not been answered in hours. No one has told me whether they are working on it or when it will be fixed. The big banks may be monsters, but at least I can always get my money when I need it. They say in relationships you don’t know who someone is until you’ve had a fight/been through hard times. finor is a perfect fair weather bank. Just hope you don’t ever need a solution for a problem you didn’t cause. Or any support for that matter. So disappointed in finor.finor: Since you don't respond to any negative reviews on here in any helpful way and only ask for the business name (in a place where we can't respond). I'll point out that this only proves the unwillingness to reach a solution. You can easily find the business in this case as I submitted the explanation above almost verbatim in my phone and support tickets. I don't need a response here. I need a debit card.","Apr 5, 2023","April 03, 2023",1,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"If you have any issues w/ your funds w/ this bank, contact the Comptroller of Currency IMMEDIATELY","Let me say this first, anyone having any issues with this bank, I’d advise you to contact the OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF CURRENCY  report any issues . Also contact THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION.I’d strongly advise every small business to avoid this “bank” at all cost. After being with this bank for two years, I should’ve moved my money out of this account and closed the account at the very first red flag that I noticed. 1st red flag: it took over a 3 months to receive a debit card. When I tried to follow up with a representative about my card, I realized soon after they have no live support, No chat support and no customer service number to talk to someone about any questions or concerns you have. 2nd red flag: reading the reviews online, everyone seems to have the same strange issue regarding fraudulent charges randomly being made on the their card while the card is in your possession. I know this is possibly with scammers these days, but it seems that every one is reporting the same issue in the same exact manner. 3rd red flag: finor is not a “bank”. They are a “banking platform”. So this entire time I thought my bank was with finor. Nope …it’s with a small bank called middlesex fed savings in a small town in Massachusetts. So whenever I needed help I’d call the small bank middlesex fed savings to get help and they’d say “sorry we can’t help you. You’d have to contact finor…we are the bank that holds the funds for finor but we can’t help with any customer issues”…. 4th and final red flag: I got txt msgs that a $450 fraudulent charge was made in my card at a grocery store in my city. My card was in my possession. However I called the the fraud dept number on the back of my card and informed the “specialist “ of the fraudulent charge. She said she will cut the card off, open a dispute, and send me another card… over 90 days later. I never got a new card, the dispute was said to been approved an closed back in February after 2 months of sending support tickets through the app, and I was told I’d be getting the funds credited back to my account in 24-48 business hours. Well here we are an additional month and a half later and I never received my money back and there’s no way to reach anyone Because they ignore support tickets through the app. And the actual bank that supports finor never helps… I’d call and they’d say there’s nothing they can do to help. And that I need to keep trying to contact finor through the app or by email. This bank is corrupt and I see a lawsuit coming soon. Anyone having any issues with this bank, I’d advise you to contact OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF CURRENCY to get your money back and report in fund issues . Also contact THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION. The more ppl that take these steps , the better. I see this escalating into a big battle.","Mar 28, 2023","December 15, 2022",1,2023,2022,3,,,,,,,,,,,,

DEPOSIT YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE!I was using this bank for my freelancing so I could keep my freelance income separate and keep my taxes in a separate account. I haven't had a problem with them besides insanely long wait times for deposits which sucks but whatever. I recently deposited a hefty check for a long week of work and went through the necessary steps, logged in on the app through my iPhone, confirmed with my email it was my account, and deposited my check. I received a confirmation email about said deposited check (would be available 6 days after my deposit) and sat back to wait. Well, I just was trying to log in just to double-check the deposit and its status, only to find that all of a sudden finor bank does not have my email associated with any account in their system. I tried to reset my password, and still, no email is associated with any account. No way of two-factor authentication or alternate means of accessing the account. I email support and explain what is happening, with a screen shot of the email confirmation of the check (sent to the email address that they said is not associated with a known account) and I haven't gotten a reply from the email to support I sent earlier today. I leave my finor card at home so I didn't have access to their customer support number but I called the number that was listed recently on this website, the Trustpilot reviews, and only got a voicemail that says to email finor support.

No explanation for any of the above. That was literally criminal, as I was told by my lawyer.

Unfortunately, all those efforts to try to propose a modern, viable banking alternative for nascent organisations is completely lost in terrible customer service like very few others. This is totally unacceptable in an organisation on which a company's revenues and finances must rest. The integration they have with Plaid is flawed (this kind of technical glitch can happen) - what CANNOT happen is offering customers a response to their requests exclusively through a chat on the mobile app. Nor can it happen that there are no means of contact through the web version of the institution. Messages are responded to with utter disregard, many hours, or days later. I am truly disappointed that I took the time to open this account, and I am even more disappointed that I spent additional time trying to resolve the problems I had there, without any diligence from their side in resolving them. For anyone looking for a modern banking alternative, I highly recommend Wise. Unfortunately, it does not offer the possibility to carry out payouts quickly, but it is an organisation that works, and I have been able to verify this in different countries around the world where I operate.","Mar 23, 2023","March 16, 2023",1,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

I chose this business banking option b/c it looked like the best fit for an online business with great app integrations. But there are too many issues with basic functions so who cares if there will be app integrations when i finally get to it:1) couldn't log in for an entire day2) micro deposits to link to external accounts (bank and paypal) isn't working. Should be same day but advised it could take upto 3 business days max. It's been 6 business days and nothing.3) reached out to Support and they advised the same message of it should be 3 days, if not check the account info was entered correctly with external bank. Both are correct and still no response.4) reached out via email but you cannot see the response via email or on the finor app from your computer. You have to log in via your phone. Why? If you are a fintech company that specializes in digital communitcation, shouldn't this be effortless? And when you do try the 2-factor authentication doesn't work, at one time it is via phone number and another via email. You just keep entering the info again and again to receive the same copy and paste message. If like me, you tried to use an online banking solution to make it easier for you and avoid fees, this is a big time suck. Brick and mortar banks like Capital One and Chase have much better digital communication.

One is that you can't connect it to Zelle. Another is that the connection to Venmo constantly has issues, as other here have mentioned.

I'm running a business here, and have already had one issue where a contractor needed payment and I couldn't process it because of a silly limit in finor's interface. It took almost a week for them to respond to me, by which time I had to resort to some clever juggling which will be a pain in the neck at tax time.

The next thing I see (a month after the card had expired) was a notice that a new card was sent to an address not even on my account. I immediately contacted them again. All they could offer was to send a new card ""express mail"" and that it would require a signature. But then said they could not give any tracking information so if I wasn't available for signature, it would get returned. They couldn't tell me the date it would ship or when it would arrive. Just that I needed to be there for signature if I was getting it shipped express. The only other option was ""standard delivery"" which they said could take up to 20 business days to be shipped. It is now 2 months since my card expired and I still do not have one. I've been told it's going to ship multiple times, but each time it does not and they tell me it was ""due to unforeseen circumstances"". I honestly am unsure if I'll ever get a debit card again at this point because they just don't ever ship it.

Not only is finor unprepared to provide any level of timely customer service (only making chat support available via their mobile app - not a single phone number available), but the platform takes 2x longer than any other bank I've done business with to process transactions. Furthermore, they falsely advertise their perks and don't stand by what they promise on sales calls. Every payment I try to make gets denied; they limit you to $5,000 in payments per day; they force you to use their mobile app as if business owners don't work from a desktop; and their check deposit tool is complete garbage - constantly asking for reuploads. Needless to say, we found a new bank and are terminating our relationship with finor. This was a huge mistake that I hope other small businesses don't make. If you're a small business, cash-flow is crucial. Waiting 4-5 days for checks to clear and ACH transfers to deposit isn't a business banking solution - it doesn't even qualify as a personal banking solution.

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Avoid finor Business Banking,"I am extremely dissatisfied with my experience with finor Business Banking. My account was deactivated arbitrarily and without any communication, leaving me unable to access my invoices and financial information. The customer service team was either unable or unwilling to restore my account, and I was left with no choice but to re-invoice all of my existing customers. This has caused significant inconvenience and has negatively impacted my business relationships. I am extremely disappointed in the lack of support and communication from finor Business Banking and would not recommend their services to anyone.","Feb 22, 2023","February 08, 2023",1,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

The system locked me out - even though I confirmed my email, the system gae notifcation that the password or email was incorrect and attempting to reset password, no reset password link was sent.The sign up process is rather detailed and they ask a lot of information.

Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Untrustworthy with my money,"Initially my experience with finor was good. I knew I wasn’t getting interest or phone based customer service. Writing checks and sending invoices via the app worked well. Problems arose when I had 3 credit cards stolen from me (including finor card). They were used to make charges of a few thousand each. Two of the banks returned the money immediately. finor said it would take up to 6 months. The process from there went downhill quickly. Despite having video evidence of the theft and a police report, finor kept asking me for the same info over and over again. When I would ask questions about this through the app, I kept getting template responses. The only reason I got my money back after 6 months was my steady persistence. Had I not done this finor would not have returned my money. This violates all the reasons to have a bank account: trust that the bank will treat customers fairly, protect my money, and provide excellent oversight and customer service. finor failed me on all these categories. I had to keep finor untilI got my money back. In the interim I found several better no-fee online banks - some that even pay up to 2% interest and have strong customer service that included a phone number. I would not recommend finor to anyone due to the fact it cannot be trusted to protect you or your money.","Feb 19, 2023","April 27, 2022",2,2023,2022,9,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Well it's clear to see the real and fake reviews of this company.,Well you can sure tell what reviews are fake and which reviews are real. I opened my finor account and had fraudulent charges right from the beginning.  I reported to them on 3 separate occasions that there were fraudulent charges. They didn't do a damn thing about it. I quit using the account and they began to harass me for money to cover the overdrawn account. I told them again that there was fraudulent charges. They closed the account and reported me to chexsystems and that has been a miserable experience in itself. So now because of their incompetence I suffer. Anyplace that uses chexsystems will not accept me as a customer. Customer service is the worst. Takes forever to get help or a general answer.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Easy and simple to use,"I've been banking with finor for about a year now. I had my reservations because I hadn't heard of them. I did a little research and decided to give them a try.Getting my business account setup was simple. I only needed to submit the basic documents and the links were easy enough to access without any hiccups.Using my account has been seamless and it came with a plastic debit card and a virtual debit card. The one thing I learned the hard way was that the physical card came with daily attempt limits. Even if those attempts weren't successful, the attempts counted against my daily usage. It wasn't much of a big deal except that my business is all virtual. So, 24 hours without using my card is a huge hit. I learned to use my virtual card more than my physical card. Again, no big deal after learning, but lesson learned. All in all, finor has been great! I'd recommend them to anyone needing to open an account online and not wanting the daunting task of going in to sit with a banker for an hour long sales pitch of other products.","Jan 26, 2023","January 26, 2023",5,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Automated bots that answer customer questions based on information in knowledgebases are great when they are curated correctly and can provide useful feedback. finor has a great deal of maturing to do from an overall perspective, especially in the customer service department.

I had a recent event happen where a CC Payment was rejected because even though finor showed I had $xxxx.xx available, part of the balance was pending, but didn't show pending. Confirmed by phone support. Customer Service can see a running balance on their end, but Customers don't get one. Also, you can't add an External Bookkeeper / Accountant without fully adding them as a user to Submit an Application. No way to add just a web-based login for another user.

The one time the support team could have helped me, they instead deactivated my debit card without my consent which prevented me from making essential and time critical purchases. When I tried to make the purchases using the virtual card instead, I was not able to because of a $500 limit which is frustratingly not written anywhere in the app, website or any documentation. The support team - who go by very condescending names such as Jester and Princess - were not able to do anything about the limit. I also received the debit card to my home address instead of my business address so the website/app doesn't work well either.","Jan 13, 2023","December 22, 2022",1,2023,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have never dealt with a bank that withheld information about their decisions to approve you, whether it's a loan or mortgage, just an account being opened. Any bank that cannot disclose these details should not be able to access my personal information and withhold the details.

You can send checks via the app but that doesn't make for happy contractors. We ended up getting an account set up at a birck and mortar bank but we still use finor for all of our online transactions. Not good enough for us to use only finor but good enough for us to keep open and keep using.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Very simple and easy banking,"I would recommend going with another bank. I used finor for about a year and a half. Customer service is lacking and you will receive little support anyway. If you need support, you have to submit a ticket. It also means if you have anything urgent, you’ll be out of luck. The final straw for us was when our business had changed structure and finor said it required a new account so just resubmit an application and then we’ll just transfer our funds over, easy enough. It was rejected and we received no assistance. They say “If you feel that you are receiving this message as the result of an error, please contact Customer Support.” But then customer support and they say they can’t tell you or help you and if you believe it was an error, then reapply. They were already doing business with us and had our money! We found out when applying with another bank, we needed a specific paper from the Secretary of State. The other bank had a phone number where you could talk to an agent who would actually assist you instead of giving the runaround. Since my account had tens of thousands all the time, I can only assume they care about the accounts with hundreds of thousands or millions, but at that point you really should have a “real” bank who will almost certainly give you no fees and real customer services at that level anyway. Then they email me to spread the word and give 5 stars? finor doesn’t seem to care about the customers they have by providing little to no support, go find a real bank or credit union. You don’t want to be in a situation where your business is at a standstill while you wait for a bank who just refuses to help you.","Jan 11, 2023","January 10, 2023",5,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

The stripe integration, multiple reserves, and referral program has been a great asset to my business.What I think finor needs to improve on is it's customer support and it's fraud prevention. I have referred finor to so many people only to find that they had terrible experiences with finor (hackers charging thousands to their accounts and the support team being incredibly unhelpful in solving this issue). It spooked me out because I do not want my money to be vulnerable and asked the support team if I could have some reassurance on specifics from their fraud prevention team.I did not find their support team helpful and did not get any specifics on their fraud prevention processes.I have noticed that now, I get text messages that alert me every time I log in to make sure it is safe, double check the url and email, etc. This is an improvement.It just sucks when I spoke so highly of finor within my network and recommended finor to many businesses only to see that their experiences were one of fraud, lack of security, and their funds vulnerable. I hope finor continues to improve their safety + security measures.The app itself is user friendly, with awesome integrations, and this is why I give it four stars.","Jan 11, 2023","January 11, 2023",4,2023,2023,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Janice told me that I needed to submit the dispute through the website AND that I needed to either provide proof that *I* had contacted the vendor to request a refund OR provide them with a letter indicating that I wanted them to take 120 days to refund my money.  During the course of the conversation I advised Janice that I didn't have to do this with any other my other banking partners to which she replied: ""Sir, we aren't a bank, we're a Fintech company"".  finor ... bank ... isn't a bank.  It's a FINTECH company masquerading as a bank.  I'm executing transfer of my money immediately.  This ""Bank"" is TRULY FUBAR.","Dec 30, 2022","December 30, 2022",1,2022,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Opened a small business account and they emailed me at 9AM that I needed to respond by 11AM or they would return a check I wrote because it has a duplicate check number from before.  Apparently they expect their customers to be at their beck and call all hours of the day, but good luck getting a hold of someone.  You leave a message on some voicemail and it disappears into the ether. No access to Venmo, Zelle or Paypal.  I withdrew money with my finor card from a Chase ATM and the machine didn't dispense money, it took 9 days for them to even acknowledge my claim, then they told me I had to go to Chase (not true), then they finally accepted my claim and told me it would take 4 months to resolve. 4 months !!!! Entire countries can go bankrupt in that amount of time. The only reason my account is still open is because we are in month 3 of 4 and as soon as I get that cash back... byebye finor, I'm going to a reputable bank instead.","Dec 29, 2022","December 28, 2022",1,2022,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Absolutely disgusting. How can they call themselves the best bank for small businesses when they cannot provide any accountability for the shortcomings of their technology and then hold the customer responsible for their own problems?

Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Setting up an account was easy but there are many things they can do better.,"Summary: It seems to me finor has spent a lot of time developing, albeit useful, features, now they need to go back and spend some time on getting the basics done right so it's not a frustrating user experience.Setting up an account was easy. Using the account is pretty easy. They have a lot of good features. The customer support is pretty decent. However, there are many many annoyances that aren't addressed.For example, I can't use the web app to contact customer service. It means I have to do all interaction with them on the phone, which is extremely tedious and inefficient. It's been a long time and they keep promising this for the web, and it's not forthcoming. Every time I log in now, since a few months back, I'm prompted that it's a new machine, then I need to get a confirmation code via SMS. But that's not enough, they send me an email too, which takes minutes to arrive. Every time I login I go through that crap, and it makes using the webapp a frustrating experience. CS should triage this at this point instead of reassuring me. Have someone actually help me because it's clearly an issue. I'm a software developer and I know what I""m doing. It's not me.Telling customer service about this problem they just tell me it will sort itself out. Then I wait, and the ticket gets closed, and I Have to open a new one. It should be easy to re-open another ticket, but it's not. You have to create a new one each time, so you end up with a ton of tickets. It's not easy to see if a check has been cashed or not. the language is confusing, and they don't provide an image of the check with a signature that I've seen other banks do.It also took a long time for me to send a check, and I was under the impression it would be sent out sooner, so the communication there could be tightened. Having to submit my ID again after being a customer awhile, otherwise risking account closure or whatever was really weird to me. On the road and being busy traveling, I don't have time to submit my ID on a regular basis. That's silly. Customer services are outsourced to other countries. If you care about this, then it's probably not for you. I don't care about it as long as the people are competent and have the right amount of empowerment. The correspondence itself with CS on the app is confusing. You just have a list of messages, and there's no subject to give any indication what the ticket was about. If you want to find a ticket, good luck. For example, I have a number of tickets that just say ""Thanks for reaching out, we see you have a chat open about the issue, so we'll let that person handle it"". Why bother without even mentioning what the issue is linked to?I had a payment fail due to ""network issues"". This shows up as a transaction on mint.com and I didn't get an email saying it failed.  There was no re-attempt and I wasn't notified and thus was late on my monthly payment=========== REMEDIES ==========This is what you should do:1. Tickets should have a clear subject, right now each just says Me, and possibly a list of names. This is not useful.2. Get the web fixed for handling tickets.3. Fix the login issues on the web4. Don't ask me to send ID on a regular basis or risk disrupting my service5. Be clear when checks are sent, have been cashed etc.6. Notify customer on declined payments due to network issues or re-attempt","Dec 21, 2022","December 20, 2022",3,2022,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rated 1 out of 5 stars,SCAM ALERT!!!,"finor IS TERRIBLE. Stay far far away. Terrible customer service (mostly bots and automated responses). They hold your check deposits way longer than federal finance laws allow. I'm currently dealing with them holding a very large check deposited from my own personal IRA savings to finor, and they claimed they needed to hold the check for 2 months due to ""security concerns."" They reduced that to 1 month as a ""courtesy."" I have proof that they received the funds two business days after I deposited the check, and despite uploaded documentation, they continue to give me bogus reasons why they must hold the funds to ""protect my account."" In the meantime I lost a home and home office I wanted to purchase due to finor's check hold. They are a fintech advertising banking services when in fact they are not a bank. Their mobile deposit agreement says they do not follow Regulation CC regarding check holds.

Thankfully, I was on my phone and able to lock the card before more money was stolen.  The charges originated from a merchant called ""True NT90s Bar Restaur"" located in Accra, Ghana (my business is local in Utah, USA...).  I disputed the charges with finor and after over 4 months of no updates, they email me saying that the dispute has been rejected due to ""3d secure code"" (WTH does that mean??).  I am still missing over $1800 that was stolen and I will continue to fight to get this money back.

Stripe sends me money and says 2-3 days, finor sees that and fronts me the money immediately. This is incredible for small business cash flow. Further, I took advantage of their $10k in free processing deal they had with Stripe. These are the types of things that make business owner's lives easier.

Unfortunately, security and the customer support needed after an incident were alarming. Yesterday I received a robocall that informed me that there was a potentially fraudulent charge on my Middlesex Savings Bank account. I didn't know what that was, so when I googled and found out it was the owner of finor, I was confused - I have two factor turned on, haven't usd my account in months, and don't share the account with anyone. I called the number back, input the requested info, and was greeted by an Indian call center, which I immediately took as a scam and hung up. Upon loking into my account, I saw a $15 pending charge - no info was listed on where the charge was attempting to be processed, or any other info, just the amount and that it was pending. So I continue to look for a way to contact their support team on their website while logged in. NO phone number listed, NO live chat feature, just a robot, and NO way to contact support outside of their app. So I had to download their app, send an email letting them know I needed my account closd permanently. There is no way I would every trust my money, or my business in the hands of a company with absolutely ZERO customer service, especially in a time of fraud - ask for customer service and the best you will get is a call from an Indian call center, which they should probably know is going to be widely viewed as a scam due to the amount of scamming that goes on in Indian call centers.

After 120 days, I reached out to finor to be given the runaround, calling every day for the dispute department to tell me that there is nothing they can do and that I would have to contact the police department if I would like to pursue or file a report. At this point, it has already been 150 days. While disputing the original claim I also receive another fraudulent charge to my account. so that is a total of two charges that total almost $500.

I watched and read plenty of reviews, did my due diligence and settled on finor over the competition. I was excited by the description of a completely online banking experience where I could deposit checks electronically, have separate ""reserves"" and integrate finor with my QuickBooks and Zapier subscptipns. The setup was fairly easy and I was approved for an account within a week. I was then informed that I needed to fund the account and navigated to the ""Move Money"" screen so I could mobile deposit my most recent invoice check. That is where I discovered that new accounts have deposit and check mailing limits in the amounts of $20k for mobile deposits per check and per day with a maximum of $40k deposited per month, and a check mailing limit of $5k per check and per day with a maximum of $50k in mailed checks per month. The check I wanted to deposit was over $60k. I submitted a support request to have my limit increased but was denied and told that I could get a temporary limit, but that limit would then expire every month and I would have to continue to resubmit. Unfortunately this limit makes finor useless to me and my business. I was hopeful that finor would make my life easier but with the limits imposed, the app would require as much time (and cause as many headaches) as my traditional bank. Ultimately I ended up cancelling my account and will explore other avenues.","Nov 3, 2022","November 02, 2022",2,2022,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Thumbs-down from me,"This is not at all what I signed up for! I can't pay most of my business bills, the ""support"" articles are largely unhelpful, and the whole experience has been disappointing. There is no in-person chat feature for questions. I've de-funded my account and just want to close it and move on, but that's also proving to be a challenge. I really hope they up their support game, and soon.

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Transaction Disputes and Terrible customer service,"I had no issues with the bank until my cards were stolen out of my wallet in a locked locker at the gym.  A total of 5 debit/credit cards were stolen and transactions made of $200 at the nearest walmart. Of course a police report was filed immediately and all banks/credit cards were notified with a dispute. All funds were returned except finor Bank which was swiped 5 times totaling $1000.  Multiple calls were made to several finor customer service reps after not receiving a letter from the bank as stated in the app.  None of the reps were any help except for the last lady, ""Chanelle"" on 9/20/22 who couldn't even find the dispute on file.  She thankfully wrote a dispute ticket in efforts to help me.  On 10/12/22 finor, after whatever review stated they would not return the funds because of ""WM SUPERCENTER"".  I have no clue what that means but I told every customer service rep that I can supply the police report if need.  Clearly it I was robbed yet, the bank failed to protect my funds or offer a solution.","Nov 1, 2022","August 26, 2022",1,2022,2022,2,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Issue with unauthorized transfer of funds out of my account!,"I had a recent issue where funds were transferred out of my account without notice, without authorization, and without any details to indicate why the funds were withdrawn and by whom. It took several rounds with tech support to get any information.  Eventually it was shared that another service had requested the withdrawal, again, with no notice to us and without the ability to contest it or request additional information. finor needs to do a better job of alerting account holders - in advance -  when they are going to withdraw funds when the transaction has not been authorized by the account holder. They also need a process to allow the account holder to contest a disputed withdrawal before it happens.Finally, it is only possible to contact support via the app and not the website. This greatly negatively impacts our ability to share information and resolve issues.Finally, the support team was not as responsive as I would expect and I had to follow-up with them several times to get the answers I needed.","Oct 24, 2022","October 19, 2022",2,2022,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Simple and efficient,"I've had an account for two months. The overall experience has been good. I've deposited seed money from a personal check via the app, set up recurring payments via the electronic debit card, used the physical debit card, added my state's Doing Business As name onto the account, had a couple of questions answered by the Support team. All of the above worked as advertised. I like that I don't need to maintain a minimum balance like some of the big banks require. I also like that the customer experience seems targeted to startup businesses. Someday I will probably use one of the integrations (maybe Stripe). The only unexpected things have been: the app dollar amounts update at different times on different pages, so one page can say that a check has been deposited, but another page disagrees; and the web site doesn't have a way to communicate with Support, so you have to use the app for that.","Oct 24, 2022","October 23, 2022",5,2022,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

The customer service number they do have will only connect you with someone who will inform you “their policy and procedures prevent supervisors and account specialist from making and receiving phone calls” Which means anyone who can help you, can’t make or receive phone calls.

How about finor secures their information and protects consumers instead of placing the blame on us? The website and app work fine.

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,TERRIBLE Customer Service. Worst banking experience I've ever had.,"finor is the worst ""bank"" experience I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. Their customer service is absolutely abysmal. I've had my finor account for several months and it seemed to work well but then suddenly all of my debit cards quit working and several recurring transactions setup failed. There's plenty of money in the account but transactions are failing due to ""Security"". Please inform me how my recurring monthly payment to Shopify was flagged for ""security"". It's not as if Shopify is some shady fly by night internet scam they're a huge company. Talking to ""Customer Service"" which in the case of finor should be called ""Customer Pass Around"" was AWFUL. You can't initiate customer service through their website you have to chat through their mobile app. The only phone number they have is on the back of the debit card and good luck calling that. You'll listen to an annoying techno beat for hours and finally give up. I seriously think they just have a number that plays music. I've never successfully had anyone pickup the phone. finor bank is awful and I am closing my account today.","Oct 6, 2022","October 06, 2022",1,2022,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,If You're Looking For Small Business Support finor Isn't It!,"October 4, 2022On Wednesday, September 28th I initiated a $200 ACH transaction from my Chase Account to finor Account. On Thursday, I checked my account to verify if the funds were posted. Later in the day I tried to make a small Amazon purchase for business supplies. I also tried to add my finor debit card to Instacart and the $0.10 authorization was declined for both my physical card as well as my virtual card.I immediately reached out to support for help. I have been contacting support since the 29th trying to find out why my account withdrawals have been frozen. I did not receive any communication from finor that I would not have access to my funds.On yesterday I submitted another support request asking that a supervisor or manager contact me. This request has also gone unanswered. I tried to initiate a transfer twice today and I still do not have access to my funds. The responses that I have received from Tia and Angela M have not addressed the issue. I told Angela on Friday that we were going into the weekend, and I needed the matter resolved. Today is October 4th and I’ve yet to hear back from. It is apparent that finor does not care about its customers. And their customer service is less than lack luster because you can never physically speak to anyone. finor’s support is non-existent when you need assistance.I also had two fraudulent charges made by 7ARTS LTD. SOFIA BG in June totaling $4.00. I immediately disputed both charges in June of 2022. It is now October, and I still have not gotten this issue resolved.  finor states that it takes up to 120 for answer. This is beyond ridiculous. It should not take a bank or any financial institution  4 months to reverse. Although the sum of money is small it is still mine.finor is toying with my finances and that is not acceptable.

It was their fault that my money was stolen because they didn't do the right thing on time. Now I need to wait for 120 days to have a result on my dispute ( I bet they will tell me that money can't be recover). They don't protect you from fraud and their customer service is useless. I don't have any documentation to show that I made a dispute only some messages where  they give me their sympathy. I don't need their sympathy, I need them to protect my money.

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Will Make Your Operations & Finances Harder,"I've used finor for about two years now.Their promise is Business Banking That Saves You Time & Money. I cannot speak for everyone, but in my case, they have cost me a great deal of both time & money. And they don't seem to care. I have multiple businesses with multiple bank accounts and we use finor for all of them (until I close all our accounts later this week). Although I'm clearly extremely annoyed at the time of writing this review, I aim to make this useful & honest. So here's the good and the bad. The good... Getting started with finor is relatively easy & fast. They integrate with many of the most common apps that most small businesses are using (Stripe, Slack, etc). They also have a reserves feature that lets you basically allocate funds to have set aside (if you use Profit First this is convenient). Their support team is friendly and sometimes tries to help.In the beginning, this was a great experience. However, my trust in finor and its operations has slowly deteriorated. The bad. Although they offer a small variety of essential integrations, they have an issue with re-connection. Sometimes this can cause serious problems. I'd love to share with them what some of these problems are so they could improve their operations like a normal business. But they don't seem to care. So here's what you can expect...1. Don't expect it to be easy to fund your account. Sometimes it'll be seamless. Other times it'll disconnect and refuse to reconnect. Getting any meaningful support for something like this is non-existent with finor. After many attempts of running through the process, you're pretty much left with reporting a bug. And if what you're trying to do is urgent, you're out of luck. My hunch is that they're outsourcing this tech and actually have very little control over it/understanding of it. On top of this, you have a maximum deposit amount of like $1,500 (or someone where that ballpark). Like what on earth are we supposed to do with that?2. They logging on and off is ridiculous. Especially if you use them for more than one business. You're required to retrieve a code (often from both email & phone) within 30 seconds. Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful that they make security a priority. But there has to be a better way. Often, it's pretty difficult and stressful to get all this information from those locations that quickly. Sometimes I won't get it in the first 1-2 attempts and by that time I've wasted enough of my day trying to log into a bank account...Here's how I'd evaluate the fit for finor...- You're a small business owner that often interacts with your own banking (transfers, cash infusions, etc)... DO NOT CONSIDER THIS BANK UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE- You're a business owner that very rarely needs to do any of the things above. This is a great bank for you. Our finance team and investors literally thanked me when I brought up switching from finor. This is honestly a heartbreaking review for me to write, I should be a brand ambassador for finor and a constant source of referrals (cause all the potential is there). But they can't get it together and have created an adversary in the process.Edit: After interacting with their team more, I decided to update this to a one star review. Because the customer support with this ordeal has been not very competent. Obviously, for a bank that deals in small business... none of them have ever actually owned a business and it's extremely clear.","Oct 3, 2022","September 24, 2022",1,2022,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Sub-par at best,"Sub-par at best. I’m not sure how finor has such high reviews on NerdWallet and etc. As other reviewers have stated, depositing checks is a painfully slow process. Running a business requires cash flow, and I had checks take up to 9 days to appear in my account, which is simply unacceptable. Most notably, as my business has grown, finor had only hindered us. I was expecting a large check (48k), and to avoid any issues with it, I contacted customer service to make sure everything was in order. I was told to apply to increase my check deposit limit (which was at 20k), and was approved. When I deposited the check, it was rejected. Twice, without explanation. Customer service’s advice? “Speak to the check issuer to make sure their checks meet federal formatting standards” or “take a credit card payment” or “request an ACH transfer.” I opened an account with Chase the next day and they deposited the check with zero issues. Customer service has been AWFUL throughout my experience, mostly because your only option is to chat with someone in the app. If you try calling the phone number on the back of your bank card, you’ll get an answering machine. It’s beyond frustrating to be unable to speak with a human being when you’re dealing with an issue as pressing as this was for me. All this said, if your business is super duper small and you don’t need much support, speed, or cash flow, finor may work for you. As others have stated, if you intend to scale your business, don’t bother with finor. Go straight to a traditional bank.","Oct 13, 2022","September 26, 2022",2,2022,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

No Phone Support even for fraud issues, outside the call concerning the fraud transaction as they were happening.   2. It takes at least 24 hours to get a canned message  3. No live chat support   4. Only contact method is on mobile, you can not message via desktop login Fraud-  1. I had fraud transaction on my debit card and finor contacted me asking about the transactions. We deputed all over the phone. I thought it was done. 2. They wont replace my business debit card after 3 request and 2 months. Hard to do businesses with a virtual debit card only. They wont give a reason why. 3. 3 days after the fraud I tried calling finor, I had to call back and ask about the money being returned to my account. No phone support, we had to handle this via email. At that time I was instructed to call the companies that had the fraud transactions and ask for a refund or negotiate a refund and supply the proof to finor. I refused to call because I was the victim of fraud and asked them how is it even possible for me to call a company in Europe when I can't call international or have there phone number. 4. I was told they have 120 day to review the dispute, it took them 65 days to return 1 transaction and they denied 1 other, I still have 1 more in dispute. 5. I have asked finor for proof I completed the transaction and why I shouldn't be refunded, currently unanswered at the moment. 6. I had to login and submit blank pages with my dispute because I didn't have proof of negotiating with the fraud vendors. Overall this has been my worst bank experience to date. I fully plan on closing my account when the deputes are completed. I have written proof of everything above and would be will to show proof so this review stays up.

This financial company is a fraud.Update 11/5 - response from support email is to use app for response.  finor shut down the account and password.  There is no way to contact these jokers.  We are preparing a lawsuit and making formal complaints with State and Federal banking regulators.  This type of predatory bank is illegal.  They have my phone number I gave it when I setup the account.  If they were truly trying to resolve the issues they would reach out.  All these review sites that give them positive reviews are paid reviews.  There are legitimate online banks but this is not one of them.11/16/2022No response to this case number at all.   Two months and I still don't have a check from these people.  Do not put your money here.  All I've gotten from them is message they sent a check that was months ago and a message confirming my address.  Never do the respond to my request they apparently done have phones because they can't be bothered to call and resolve the situation.12/7/2022 UpdateStill no check from finor.  3 months.  I have confirmed my 2 addresses with them all they ever say is we sent a check.  That is a lie or if you sent the check it never arrived and finor has an obligation to reissue the check.  It is not their money and it must be returned.  Sometimes I will get an email when I post reviews here or facebook or other places.  They have my phone number I have asked them to call several times not once do they call.  I respond to every email they send but never receive a response to my reply email.  Then in a couple weeks another automated email how was your support experience.  Support is NON-EXSISTENT.  Do not do business here you have been warned.12/10/2022Funny when every I post new complaints and reviews this company emails us but it never resolves the issue and send a check.    finor emails us claiming we never responded to their 11/21 email which is false.  We again sent a email with the 11/22 email attached.  Again asked that they call and resolve the issue.  12/9/2022 we filed a formal complaint against Middlesex Federal Savings (MFS).  finor bank is listed as a branch of MFS on the FDIC's website.  We are also working formal complaints to be filed with banking regulators in the states of FL, WY and MA which all have nexus based on theirs and our business operations.  These two entities Middlesex Federal Saving and finor Bank are dishonest and I implore you not to do business with them.  The chance is high based on reviews you will have a nightmare in dealing with them.  Any company that won't provide a phone number for support should really raise a red flag.","Oct 12, 2022","September 07, 2022",1,2022,2022,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

The app works very well and I like that they're always adding new features. It has fulfilled my business needs so far. The support sucks though. It's usually not a problem, because the app works well most of the time, but there's bound to be a problem once in a while and because finor doesn't really have customer support, it's a terrible experience when a problem does arise.

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Fraud protection doesn't exist,"Fraud protection is borderline nonexistent at finor.  May 28th (holiday weekend), my business banking was drained to 0 balance with a series of 50+ charges on my finor card.  I never even had a physical card.  They began small and then ramped up.  Once the larger charges were rejected, they went down again until my balance was under 10 dollars.  They requested I click to file fraud on every single transaction (about 5 clicks each).  There is no such thing as phone support.  Today is 9/14 and I've received ~150 dollars back of the approximately $4000 in fraud charges. finor keeps reiterating that it can take up to 120 days for fraud investigations.  This doesn't explain how 3 charges were refunded so far but the rest have not closed out.  Doesn't explain how that many transactions at the same place in a single day, that were obviously structured were allowed to go through. Even if in 2 weeks (120 days) I receive the remainder back it slowed business growth drastically over the last 4 months with being unable to purchase equipment.  Their interface is slick, their integration is great but when push comes to shove the bank behind the curtain has serious problems.","Sep 14, 2022","June 01, 2022",1,2022,2022,3,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had to escalate my concerns to an extreme level in order to be refunded money from nearly $7000 is fraudulent transactions that I immediately flagged.  I cancelled the card but within days the card was still live and more transactions piled on.  I finally won but only after literally calling executives at Middlesex Federal who deny they have any control of finor, which is false.   I now have two transactions from weeks ago (modest amounts compared to the prior fraud).  Again I flagged them as fraud within a day of their hitting my account. They are from a business in Abu Dhabi that is clearly a front for fraud.  No action taken by finor after weeks. I get messages that make no sense by email stating that I did not respond to their so called ""support"".  I did respond but they did not act or respond or engage in any dialog. The ""bank"" is treating obvious frauds as ""chargebacks"".  They rely on the relatively lax controls over business debit cards to ignore their fiduciary obligations.   I suggest that anyone who experiencing the same issues I have should contact the office of the UC Comptroller and register complaint.  This so called bank has a decent ""platform"" in terms of software.  It is a joke as a bank and not a secure environment, period.  Run don't walk.

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Avoid finor :-(,"Unsatisfied, I am switching away from finor. I told them that I'm disappointed and I'm switching away. The next week they sent me an email asking me to post a review on Trustpilot. Here it is:Avoid finor. :-(finor declined two separate deposits recently. Both were checks from customers. I had nobody to speak to about these problems, but I could access live chat during their business hours or send emails. When I asked WHY each check was denied, they told me in one case ""the time is not negotiable.""  I asked what that meant, because the date was clear on the check. I was able to deposit both of these checks without incident at my local credit union -- even after needing to alter the endorsement that I had originally prepared for finor.From what I can tell, finor is a software front end for another bank. When things go well, they are great.  But when things to wrong you're stuck dealing with the people who work for the software company and not the bank.  If the software people (finor) can't help you, that's a dead end. Also, I think the finor people are nice, but it feels like they're moving too fast and making mistakes. For instance with my deposit problems which occurred on different days, they decided to group them together. So when I said ""hey you declined another deposit, can you tell me why this time?"" they didn't read anything and just grouped it with the last one.","Sep 13, 2022","August 26, 2022",1,2022,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Love finor, but...","I am very surprised by the number of bad reviews I have read on here, but the one consistent thing I see in the bad reviews that I agree with is finor's strict rules regarding acceptance of checks. I have never in my entire life had a bank tell me that a check isn't acceptable because it has been ""altered"" and then not tell me what was altered about it and completely refuse to give me any information about what is wrong with the check which was a professional business check that would be accepted by any other bank. finor put me in a very awkward position with a client of mine where I had to tell them I could not accept their check, but then not be able to tell them WHY I couldn't accept their check. I assumed that if they issued me a new one, it would have the same problem as the old one so I had to make this professional business VENMO ME to pay me which was extremely embarrassing.With that said, I have only had this issue one time so far and I hope to never have it again or these stars on my review will continue to go down! finor, you need to wake up and figure out a better check processing system. Your rules are truly insane and your lack of communication about issues with completely acceptable checks is unacceptable.With that said, everything else about this online bank is great. I love the app. I have always had quick responses from customer support. This business bank is exactly what I needed as a freelancer.","Sep 13, 2022","September 13, 2022",4,2022,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

One check was $441 and the other was for $479 (both printed checks was from the same HOA management company) somehow the check for $479 was rejected, they would not tell me why and just told me to request a new check from the vendor or have them do a ACH transfer, I own a commercial cleaning business so 99% of my payments are by check from these other company’s I’ve never had a check reject in my 3 years of owning this business as I only deal with larger reputable companies so that was flag number 1. Once the check in the amount of $441 cleared I tried sending money using the virtual card on the app, finor kept declining the transaction even though the money was cleared, so I waited a few days until I got the physical debit card and tried activating and it would not activate contacted support (customer support is horrible seems like they send the same prewritten responses) and found out my account is frozen which caught me by surprise, I keep asking for information to why it’s frozen, and I keep getting a generic response “your account is currently frozen and under review, while under review we can’t provide any information or give you a time frame until the review is complete” so It’s been 2 weeks and my account is still under review mind you I have funds in the account I clearly can’t access, they will not tell me why the account is frozen, they keep saying they don’t know how long the review will take and can’t provide a estimate time, like this is crazy, I’m currently looking into legal action as I believe this company is a fraud/ scam and based on other reviews, I’ve seen they are several people that this same situation has happened to and they are going on months with their accounts still be frozen and no access to fund for whatever reason finor decided to freeze, not sure a new account, with no transactions, no activity is placed on freeze and not given any information as to why, I’ve had other real business bank accounts and if they were frozen I was given information as to why so that I could either verify identity or provide documentation to unfreeze the account as you are legally required ti provide.

Back in June I made a deposit from another bank to my finor account for my car payment. I sent more than enough to cover the payment, however finor took a week to post the funds to the account unbeknownst to me, and the payment was rejected. Next thing you know, 2 wks later the bank has repo'ed my car, but I can't call finor because they don't have a regular CS line and everything is handled via messages on their app...not even on their website. If you're lucky enough to get a quick response (because you probably won't...usually have to wait a couple of hours or more), you're met with a CS rep who copies a rote response from a script and subsequently closes your ticket. Meanwhile, I go ahead and make an Express ACH payment through the finor website to the bank my car is financed by, and pay the extra $20 for the service so the funds are expedited. Here we are, 2 days later and the auto financing still has no trace of any payment from me, pending or otherwise, while my car languishes at an impound somewhere, racking up daily fees. While this is going on, I am obligated to rent a car to get to work and doctors appts. (I am a cancer patient), so this is really beginning to add up, all while I remain waiting for someone, ANYONE at finor to get back to me and tell me where the hell my money is.

Additionally, what this person did not say is that even if you happen to get ahold of the phone number, you need an active account number to reach a person. You'll be prompted to enter an account number before getting transferred to someone and if the account has been closed you'll get a message that you have to email support and then you'll get hung up on.BEWARE. I have wasted hours upon hours of my time trying to accomplish basic banking tasks with finor. For example, I needed my debit card replaced and called the number listed on their site for that specific task. The woman who answered asked me what company I was trying to reach (it seemed like she didn't actually work for finor and was handling calls for a bunch of different companies), she couldn't locate my account, and said she couldn't help me. After several frustrating interactions like that with them, I found a new, better bank. I've requested a closing statement (which they are required to provide by law since I had EFT transactions during the period), and they are refusing to send me one. There is also no way to speak with customer service unless you are an active customer. STAY AWAY from this so-called bank. There's a big reason they're free--it will cost you more in time than any other bank could ever charge in fees. There are so many other options out there (ex: BlueVine, CapitalOne, etc.).","Jun 15, 2022","June 14, 2022",1,2022,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 3 out of 5 stars,finor is great if you start transfering…,"3pm Update... a few hours later... before my review below went live, i recieved a msg that my limit had gotten updated... this time only the monthly, almost got aggravated, but it chatted back to please raise daily as well... about 3 hours later, it was raised.... maybe there is hope yet.I am going to leave the below review unaltered... Disappointment comes with unfulfilled expectations. So, set your expectations accordingly.finor was easy to setup, and easy to use online, with several free integrations... so, if you proceed,. just go plan ahead as much as possible, and plan on excercising your patience when you need urgency.Raised from 1 to 310amfinor is great if you start transfering money 15 to 30 days before you actually need it.  I am at day 10 currently.  I put $xxx,xxx,xxx.xx into finor, and they kindly approved by transfer limit increases.  There is only one raise option to request at a time... per transaction, daily, or monthly.  Thankfully, the first 'bot' that approved my limit increase, could tell that a daily increase approval needed the corresponding monthly increase.  The standard limit is $xxxx.xx... I appreciate the possible fraud protection, but I can't do much business with that.Not this time... approved my daily increase... but left the monthly limit the same... almost funny.So... when you're losing thousands of dollars a day because a transaction wont fund because of 'bot' incompetence... you are going to want to talk to someone.Again, not here... it will be three days before you get an email, then three more for a response to ask if its correct, then three more for 'bot' implementation.Hehe.Jokes on me for thinking I could give a 'chat bot' almost $xxx,xxx,xxx and expect a good outcome.Lesson learned.Edit about 30 min later... I think everyone should have a go with finor... then there will a massive driving force of people to FIX this chat bot mentality of customer service... everyone who thinks they have a good app idea is using it along with minimal support to go out and get rich... maybe stick to making games... my kids will love it.(the next generation could use some exercises in delayed gratification)","Jun 15, 2022","June 13, 2022",3,2022,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"This is an absolutely terrible ""bank""","This is an absolutely terrible ""bank"". I've been with them for a few years, ever since azlo closed and they poached a lot of their small biz customers. the difference between azlo and finor is night and day. for one, with finor they make it nearly impossible to reach someone. they have a number on the back of the card that - should no one be available to take your call (in the middle of business day hours) they ask you to leave a voice mail - which they never respond to. then, their live chat thing is totally horrible. this is a BANK, with actual MONEY - and you can't reach someone during business hours by any means. As of this week (may 31st and onward) finor has a new option for ""Express ACH"" and there a ""standard ACH"" as well. with express you pay 1.5% up to 15 dollars on a transaction to receive the money same day, or next day, with the standard option taking up to 3 business days. will guess what? before there was an express option, ALL ACH TRANSACTIONS POSTED TO MY ACCOUNT IN ONE BUSINESS DAY - so they're blatantly lying now about ""no fees"" - there is a 1.5% fee to do what used to be free. I used to recommend finor to anyone starting a small business account and at this point I couldn't get my money out of my account any faster. when this 'express transaction' posts to my account (in what looks to be 3 business days, actually... absolutely crazy), I will take the rest of the money out of the account, and never work with finor again.","Jun 14, 2022","June 03, 2022",1,2022,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

On 5/13/2022 I made an instant deposit of $51.00 via PayPal because that's one of the options according to the App and my money was instantly taken from my PayPal account only to not be instantly deposited into the finor account. After about an hour I try contacting support with no luck. 5/14/2022 I receive an email from finor that my account has been flagged for fraudulent activities and they placed a temporary hold on the account. Keep in my mind my $51.00 deposit still hasn't arrived and finor is telling me that they got no record of me ever depositing anything into the account. Fast forward to 5/27/2022 my account is still flagged and my deposit is sitting in the account but I can not withdraw my funds because they froze the account. Now I'm being told that they are closing the account and will not offer any explanation as to why also any funds that remain in the account afterwards will be mailed to me in 7 to 10 business days after the account is closed. 5/31/2022 the account is still opened but all transactions are frozen and they will not let me withdraw my money back to my PayPal or any bank account for that matter.

NOT once was I ever contacted by anyone at the bank during this process. Today I was told the merchant won their claim and I would not be refunded. It was an $800 transaction for legal preparation in which the service was never provided. In fact I had to hire an attorney to start the process all over again. The company missed several deadlines refused to finish my file. Failed to respond to BBB and even told me to lie to the courts because the company forged my signature which is Penal code violation PC115 and classified as a felony.

First I had multiple times where a deposit sat pending for weeks and I kept going round and round with them as to why.  When I already was switching banks, my debit card suddenly has fraud charges on it.  I am frantically trying to cancel it and can’t get an answer on the “24/7” line.  I was finally on the phone for the one when a second went through.  I jumped through all their hoops and contacted the vendors, they said they submitted the agreement to refund it but finor only returned the smaller charge.  I keep asking and they say it takes a while…I am talking months.  I also sent a check through them and it never arrived and still shows pending.  No way to cancel or anything…again MONTHS later.  If you talk to their customer support, they just say they have to email another department. From my conversations everything is third party and customer service is non existent.  You can chat but if they answer and don’t just close a support ticket without an answer like they have many times, you don’t really get any help.  This is your money, park it ANYWHERE else.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Canceled Service,"This is a very bad customer service bank. I called in for dispute  due to card lost, and the agent told me to go to the apps and NEED to hand written a letter saying I need to dispute? So I did, and they come back with saying 120 days wait time rules, without any letter telling me anything. No reference number, not asking me to signed anything at all. By 30 days I call (never a human answer) and I went to apps, they start telling me, not able to dispute because they ask the fraud merchant PERMISSION to return and they refuse? This is about $1K , is my hard earn money. I email them a lot in the apps, they keep sending me a standardized email “saying final verdict? And look for law enforcement?” And all CLOSED my inquiry immediately. I asking for immediate reopen the dispute. Or is that police report they needed? They are not replying. I asked someone call me back never anyone contact me. All they been very busy to closed my case in the apps. I ask for documents of prove on the dispute case they never reply.  They didn’t work on my dispute case at all! This is not a bank! It never protect your rights!Updated: I called many times and they are busy to put down my phone. I asked for supervisor to speak to, they told me they do not have one, I ask for transfer call to dispute team, they telling me no dispute team to transfer, Yet they keep telling me dispute is final Not able to help, ask for documents of proof for review- what they have work on, they saying they don’t have any documents, I ask for agent ID, she saying she don’t have one,  they are rude and they just put down my phone. I putting $100K in this bank, I’m going to a proper bank. You can not joke about your money here.I have no way to turn to, apart from giving them a bad review and report to FDIC about it!

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,finor Rejected My Application For No Reason,"Thank you finor for rejecting my application for a small business checking account because you saved me all of the headaches of dealing with your horrible company.  I have decent credit and I have not had a negative issue with my personal banking accounts for well over 20 years.  Yet when I tried to sign up for a business checking account to cover my gig work -- y'all denied me because I was high undefined risk which made me unsuitable for a business checking account.  Thankfully, upon being rejected -- I did some more digging and found that all those Youtube videos praising finor were pretty much lies.  As well, I signed up with another company and they gave me a business checking account within minutes of me making my application.  Finally, I will say that finor totally sucks in every way possible.  You all wasted my time big time and as well attempted to insult my intelligence.  Thanks again -- because not only have you lost me as a customer -- any of my associates will be informed to not use -- or discontinue use of -- your services because it is a total waste of time and money.","Mar 22, 2022","March 22, 2022",1,2022,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I opened the account thinking finor was advanced,"I opened the account thinking finor was advanced for today's banking needs, it was disappointing to my shock 1) they didn't provide checkbooks, the virtual checks took more than 10 days to reach the recipients, no bank takes that long other than finor. I contacted the customer care and they were pretty much useless. 2) I disputed a transaction on my account and it was less than 10 - 15 days old, it took me long to create a dispute, it wasn't a one click process, and later they sent me 3-4 emails finally saying it has passed the dispute timeline. Really ? It was a recent transaction. Not even 15 days.Take my advise do not open an account in finor.

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Great unless you actually need help,"finor Bank seems like a great idea, until you have a problem that requires the intervention of a human. That’s where things fall apart because there really is no mechanism for you to speak to a human. It’s possible, too, to be completely shut out of their app, which is the only way they will communicate with you, with the simplest of circumstances.. For example, I don’t receive email on my telephone so if I’m traveling or away from my computer I can’t give you a code sent to my email. But for some reason finor decides to do three factor identification instead of the two factor I agreed to, and send a code to both my phone and my email for verification, which leaves me without access. Even if I send them a message that says please don’t respond in the app because I can’t access the app, they sent me back a message (Which I won’t even see until later when I return to my computer) that says we’ve responded to you in the app, and they send that message sometimes as long as three or four days later. I’m standing here with my card having been eaten by a machine, the delivery date of a new card on the website listed as April 12,  a month away, unable to access the app because of the three factor authentication thing, and absolutely no way to access my own money. You souled think there be a phone number for some sort of emergency like losing your card, and there is, but it only connects you to a service that does this for them , and that service only has the phone number of Middlesex federal savings bank, which is a partner bank through which they obtain their routing number but which has no access whatsoever to their customers. So, if you plan to never have a problem, stick with finor. If you want to be prepared for things that might happen in the future, especially while traveling, do not use this bank. While the idea of an Internet only bank sounds very modern and convenient, it is the exact opposite. Go with a brick and mortar bank with a good customer service department and a good website and you will be miles ahead of this crap.","Mar 31, 2022","March 16, 2022",1,2022,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I WANT MY MONEY!!!,"On March 3, 2022 I located a customer service number to call and speak with a live person at finor regarding receiving my 15k SBA funding for my business. In fact, I called several times during this time. On March 9th, 2022 I logged into my account to check if my funds had become available as it was confirmed that the ACH had been sent. When I logged in I noticed that there was an adjustment with a code stating closeout. This was alarming and I called in to speak with someone about it as I had not used the account in recent months. The agent at the time stated that my account was active and she didn't see any indication that something was wrong with my account and would need to reach out to another department for further assistance and I would be followed up with via the app. Well, it has now been 5 days (March 10, 2022) since my finor business account was closed without notice. I had been in constant contact with the agents by phone and email the week prior and the beginning of the week of the 10th in regards to receiving grant funding from the SBA. I was actually happy with how helpful those agents were until I was logged out and none of my account information was recognized. I attempted to call as I had previously the day before this happened and now an automated system was in place and did not recognize my account number. This was alarming to me so I reached back out via email and called Middlesex Federal Savings who back finor. When speaking to Middlesex I was told I was not on the call list to call and was added at the time of the phone call which was on March 10,2022. I also sent a few emails and received a response almost immediately that my account had been closed due to an overdraft of $65.66. I immediately responded and have yet to hear back from them I was never advised of the overdraft and would have taken care of it and would like to receive my funds as I think this is not good business practice. I also requested to speak with a manager and sent and email on yesterday. Still no word.","Mar 19, 2022","March 15, 2022",1,2022,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,DO NOT USE THIS BANK!!,"My experience started well with this online bank. It met my needs. No fee bank for a very simple business account where I could deposit checks and use the debit card for business expenses. Things went very wrong Dec 21, 2021. I received a VM from finor letting me know about a possible fraud charge on my account. I checked my account. No unusually charges. To be safe I used the app to freeze my debit card. I called the number in the VM (844-682-4502) that evening and let the finor Fraud Theft Department know that I had not used my card and the charge was fraud. I still did not see any charges on my account at this time. I deactivated the card while on the phone with them at the same time. I contacted the merchant that I was told the charge was from and let them know the charges were being disputed. The merchandise had already been picked up and the merchant let me know my only recourse would be to contact my financial institution. I still saw no charge on my account. On Dec 22, 2021 the money was withdrawn from my account! So I called finor back again and was told that I would need to now dispute the charge. Remember, until then there was no charge on my account. My debit card had been deactivated. And STILL THEY LET THE CHARGE GO THROUGH 24 HOURS LATER! It is now Feb 15, 2022 and I still do not have my $1200 back! I can't talk to anyone that can tell me anything at finor. There only response is that the back car services are investigating the issue and have up to 120 days to respond and that I would receive an email. I have filed a police report in the town the fraud was done. After 30 days they still hadn't looked into it. I have written on the entire series of events and sent it to finor through the app. I have done all of the investigating myself. I told them the merchant name, what the item was, the name the person gave to fraudulently pick up the item. And still nothing? My advice. DO NOT USE THIS BANK!UPDATE: As a reply to the answer given by the Bankfinor to contact them through email. As states in my review, I have been in contact with them the more not way I am able, through their app, on a very constant basis. I send a message asking for an update every 3-4 days and get the same answer every time. They assure me their dispute team is working on it and when they have an answer they will email me. And that they have up to 120 days to do this. That's it. That is as much customer service as I can get. So again. DO NOT USE THIS BANK.

Then I went on their website and tried contacting them but no one responds for days.I also deposited $5000 to start out and cant’t even use the funds since everything gets declined even though they told me I was good to go.

Rated 2 out of 5 stars,finor: The most mediocre “bank” I’ve ever used,"I wish websites would stop referring small business owners to finor as a bank account option. It’s the most basic bank account (if you even want to call it that) than any other bank I’ve used. Firstly, it takes DAYS for most transactions to clear. The app itself is often misleading as far as how much money you have coming out when you have pending transactions. Oftentimes, the available balance doesn’t reflect what’s currently pending so you’ll think you’ll have money left over but once the pending transactions clear, only then will the balance actually show what you have left. Every bank I’ve used will show an estimated balance that also includes pending transactions. Second, they have this pointless feature called “Reserves.” I was under the impression that it was similar to One bank’s pockets in order to set money aside for taxes so it would not be spent. However, I was told those reserves don’t count as separate accounts which is the case with typical banks so if you’re low on funds but have a transaction coming out, instead of just declining or over drafting the transaction, it’ll take the money for the reserves to cover the cost which makes the reserves totally pointless since it can still be spent as if the money is still within the main spending account. I have been affected by this twice as I had money set aside for taxes and an unexpected month subscription came out and took all the reserves. There also isn’t anything in settings to prevent this by having transactions rejected rather than automatically using reserves. Reserves are basically pointless.Even switching your DBA or business name is an extended process. You’re supposedly able to change that information yourself and upload proof of business ownership but you’ll receive a message from a rep saying it can’t be changed but “do you want to remove your previous business name with your new one?”. DUH! Why would I go through the trouble of changing it myself and having to wait days for approval only for them to tell me it can’t be changed but then ask me if I want them to manually change it. The only positive thing I can say about this bank is that you can contact customer support directly in the app and they’re pretty quick to respond but I would hope so as there’s no phone number to contact them directly. You could argue since it’s a virtual bank, that’s a given but One and Varo Bank, two virtual banks I’ve been using for a few years do have phone numbers in addition to a customer support email. I know it’s hard finding a low/no fee bank specifically for small businesses as most brick and mortar banks include fees which I think is inconsiderate for businesses just starting out. However, I’d suggest using a different bank because finor is subpar with very limited features. I would not recommend it to anyone.","Feb 24, 2022","January 28, 2022",2,2022,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Complete disaster,"Complete disaster.  Steer clear.I needed a business checking account for my one-person LLC. My needs are pretty simple -- basically, deposit a handful of checks each month, and then move the money via ACH as needed to my personal checking account.  Thus, my requirements are as follows: - ability to deposit checks remotely  - no minimum balance or monthly fees - no fees for inbound or outbound ACH transfersAfter researching various online business banking options and reading reviews here on TrustPilot and other places, I decided to open a finor account.  The application process was relatively straightforward. I set up ACH transfers between my personal account and my finor account (verify the amount of two small deposits, etc.) and then transferred the necessary $50 to the finor account to activate it.  So far, so good.Next, I tried to deposit a check that I had received from my client.  Got the message ""your check is being processed.""  The next day, another message: ""we were unable to process your recent mobile deposit because altered check.""  No further explanation.  And no way to talk to a real person - all support communications are done via messaging in the finor app. So after a couple days of trading messages, I was never able to find out just what was ""altered"" about the check (it was later accepted without question at the bank I went to after this fiasco).Anyway, I then deposited another check via the app. Got the message ""we have received your check deposit . . . your deposit will be available [7 days later]""  OK, so this seems like it's working better.  But then, the next day, I get another message: ""Upon further review of your banking relationship, we have determined that unfortunately we cannot continue to provide you with a business bank account. We will be closing your account on [date]""  Note that this closure date is one day BEFORE the date of the deposit that had just been accepted.  So now I have two questions:  why was my account being closed, and how/when would I get back the deposited money that finor had accepted?Long story short, after messaging back and forth for more than 2 more weeks, I never got an answer to the first question.  All the support bots would tell me was that ""we cannot discuss the details of the account closure.""  As for the second question, my deposited check was credited to my account, then debited, then credited again, and then (more than 2 weeks later) debited as part of the account closure.  The money is being returned to me via paper check, which they say ""could take 15-20 business days"".I should also note that while all of this was going on, I continued to receive a steady stream of marketing emails from finor, letting me know about all of the wonderful features of my (closed) account, and all of the other different services they could provide.  Umm . . . no thanks.So I went into this experience thinking that I'd be fine with an online bank with no real-life customer support.  After all, my needs couldn't be more simple, so how likely was I to ever need support?  Well, I didn't count on finor creating my need for support.No matter how straightforward you think your needs might be, I strongly suggest going to a brick-and-mortar bank (or at least a better online bank, though I don't know how you would go about finding and vetting one). Your local community bank (and even some large national banks) offer small business accounts with all the same features as finor - no minimum balance, no transaction fees, no monthly fees, remote deposit, debit card, etc.  And if something should go wrong, you'll have a real person to contact.------------------------Update 1/19/21: the reply to this review from finor couldn't be more ironically perfect: they ask me to contact them with more info via the mobile app . . . but of course, they've disabled my access to the app when they closed my account.","Feb 15, 2022","January 17, 2022",1,2022,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mobile app is very user-friendly and intuitive.  It incorporates modern technology well and makes it fairly easy for customers to pay. I am impressed by the customer service too - every time I make a change to my account, there is someone on their end on top of it within a couple of hours.  They communicate with me constantly with status updates and when there is more information needed, they provide a link and a clear way to upload documentation online.  I started with one business in finor and it impressed me so much, I have since opened a second account for another business.

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,DO NOT DO IT - WORST DECISION,"By far, the worst business decision we've made. Our business currently has ZERO checks because we've been unable to order checks, in the 6 weeks that we've tried, through FIVE different companies. All of them (including Office Depot and Vistaprint) have refunded our money and informed us that our routing number does not match the account. Our guess is because finor is NOT A BANK and we have to use the info from Middlesex Bank, although in all of our ""conversations"" with the finor ""bot"", we are told to use the info we are given. How are we supposed to pay our vendors and employees with no checks??? We could send a check through finor, but the last time we did that, it took almost 2 weeks for the person to receive it and we had to pay late fees because of that.  We are super laid back, generally relaxed, and easy to get along with. We love startups and fresh new ideas...finor is not a good fit...finor needs to stop the charade because they are causing harm to small businesses who believed the hype.","Jan 13, 2022","January 09, 2022",1,2022,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

You find yourself trying to phrase your question 20 ways to the bot. Finally, they refer you to their customer service...be aware your question must be sent - and you do not get a response until at least 12 hours.  A lot of times the answer isn't what you asked at all. Nothing specific to your account. Sending a check directly from finor takes 10 business days.  You get updates on the check only to be told on the day it's delivered something was wrong- it shows up at my address instead of who I made the check out to. My employees so upset with me. There's a cap on how much you can spend of your own money a week- there's a weird game of trying to get someone to increase the amount (remember it'll take at least 24 hours for a response.) I have no idea who would actually give this bank five stars.  It's a bank with the absolute worst customer service ever.","Jan 18, 2022","January 07, 2022",1,2022,2022,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

After multiple times the bank finally sent me a PDF file of a print out from Microsoft excel with the account details, no detailed statements and lastly the closing withdrawal they would not provide any further information as to who this was paid to when, what method was used etc. This bank is a complete disaster, they are crooks, I would NOT recommend anyone in business to use them for anything at all. Their support is nonexistent  and I am still trying to figure out what happened.","Dec 20, 2021","December 08, 2021",1,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Terrible experience,"I was notified on Nov 9 that finor had shut off my debit card due to attempted fraudulent activity. It would take 2-3 weeks to deliver a new card to me. This is way too long. After not receiving my card after 2 weeks I contacted CS through the app and a new card was sent ""express"" SIGNATURE REQUIRED. FedEx claims they delivered and I signed for it when I did not. finor CS was not helpful at all in obtaining a copy of the signature, which must be done by the sender. I waited 5 business days between responses sometimes. The virtual cards they issue will not work with Gpay, and as a contractor the majority of my purchases are done at a retail location. I had no choice but to open an account with another bank and close my finor account. The first card they sent me finally arrived on Dec 6. That's almost 30 calendar days I was unable to use the account. My new bank had a debit card to me in three days.This is not a real bank and you shouldn't use it as such.","Dec 9, 2021","December 08, 2021",1,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Not a Real Bank! Don't believe the fake reviews or short term users!,"Three fraudulent Uber charges were made on my finor business credit card.  finor immediately notified me via the app of the fraud.  I verified that the charges were fraudulent and froze the credit card awaiting the issuance of a new card.  All good right!   After this initial contact I thought that finor would refund the fraudulent charges as any other “Real Bank” would do.  There is no way to contact finor customer service with exception of the message portal in the app.  It took days for them to respond and they said that I needed to contact Uber for the charges to be reversed.  There is no way to contact Uber customer service either especially if you don’t have an Uber account. (try it!)  I’m out $203.61 with no means to recover it.  I’ve since moved to another bank but before doing so I made sure that I could contact their customer support hotline and talk to a real person.  Additionally, I verified their policy of refunding fraudulent charges immediately.  Don’t settle for the new kid in town with the cheapest services, opt for a reputable “Real Bank” and not an online only type bank that is not FDIC insured even though they say their “partner” bank Middlesex is.  This is not correct! (check it out for yourself!) I’ve reported finor to the FTC and Consumer Federal Protection Bureau to try to get my money back.Update: In response to the below ""Hi there. We're very sorry to hear this and would like to look into this further. Please reach out to the support team via the support tab so we can investigate this issue.

As our business grew I would hit payment limits which were annoying but after a few messages over a couple of days I would be able to send payments again. Four days ago I tried to make a payment and it was blocked with a non-sensical error message. I had made an identical payment (same amount and account) two weeks ago but this time, no.The support is non existent this time. I have called them and sent multiple messages. I get placeholder responses about how they're looking in to the issue but no one has an answer.Bugs happen and problems happen but it's how a company solves them the shows you who they are. There is no mechanism for them to do a manual transfer out while we wait for a bug fix. I currently can't get my money out of my account and payments to my shipper and to a supplier are on hold. I will miss an early payment discount and my shipments will not move which put holiday sales at risk.All I get told is to send a message in the app which is then ignored.Do NOT use this bank for anything business critical.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars,They deserve a lot of credit for what they will do for you on a free account,"Thanks for being more accomodating as far as giving me more than enough time to come up with the money for the amount of my account being overdrawn. Most other banks probably would of allowed for it to go ten days before they closed the account. Also thanks for only charging me only the amount that went through that overdrew the account, and also for just paying that amount, otherwise you could of very well just rejected it. Also thanks for not charging me a overdraw fee, where as most banks would of hit me for $30 for that, even when they reject and don't even pay the item. So I would say for what you've done does deserve a lot of credit, especially since you don't even charge a fee for the account to begin with and then not to even charge an overdraft fee to at least make something off the account. Should I even wonder how you make any money or even why you guys want to provide these free accounts to begin with?","Oct 26, 2021","October 11, 2021",5,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Do NOT USE finor bank,"Do NOT USE finor bank. There is NO customer service line to call. Our business debit card was used fraudulently - no alert from them. I got our card cancelled, but they do NOTHING to credit your account. Oh - and there is NO PHONE number to call these people. It took them SEVEN days to respond to my request for crediting our account back, and then they want you to fill out this long form, and the email I got says it takes them SIX MONTHS to get that money back to you - if at all. Your bank card is going to get compromised (they all do at some point), and finor is going to do NOTHING about it. Oh - after we cancelled our card, which is what all of our bills are paid with....they said it will take up to six weeks to get a new card, and there is NO expedited service available. Imagine that ----no customer service, no rush, no credit back, and no fraud protection. They actually recommended we contact the Wal-mart and try to get our money back and dispute the transaction ourselves, because they don't really do that. We have changed banks - DO NOT USE finor - it works fine...as long as you don't need any support. And then they fall completely flat.Update - see their reply below to this review. Yes - my company DOES have an account with finor Bank. And rather than ""loving to look into this"" why don't you credit my account for the nearly $200 in fraudulent charges on the account, and do what a real bank would do and pursue a fraudulent charge review with Wal-mart instead of telling us that WE should try to get our money back from Wal-mart ourselves. This is EXACTLY their suggestion for EVERYTHING.... please use your support tab. We would love to look into this further for you. And then when you do, you wait days for a response, and the response is basically a bunch of work they want YOU to do because they won't. Trying to use their customer service tab is a complete waste of time. We have moved our money to real bank with real customer service.","Oct 21, 2021","October 08, 2021",1,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"A Huge, Frustrating Waste of Time","In theory, I love the idea behind finor. Simple, no fees, and integrations have been surprisingly available. BUT. There is zero support and I mean zero (this is why there aren't fees). That would be fine if simply receiving my debit card after sign up hadn't taken 2 months along with countless emails and time spent on hold just to leave a message. Their in-app customer support takes forever to get a response from (via email, 24+ hours later) and even when you do, it's the same form letter you got from the other 3 reps who replied to your phone call, email, and other chat inquiries (via email). To boot - my debit card doesn't work, just keeps getting declined. (nbd if you could call and talk to someone, right?) I have yet to hear from anyone in response to my 2 phone messages, email, and chat inquiry. Decided to just transfer our funds to my personal so I can actually use our business funds for business purposes (and even that's taking 3 days). Honestly, this has consumed more time than just paying fees at Chase would have cost me - which is where I'm headed now.","Oct 22, 2021","October 08, 2021",1,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Takes too long,"If you want fast access to your card look somewhere else. The account set up should take 1-2 days but it can easily take a week is they need any extra supporting documents, which is somewhat understandable. The part that got me mad is that it takes 3 weeks from when you finally get you account set up to receive a physical card.I needed to start making purchases with the business card and obviously couldn't. I contacted support when I saw how long it would take and there's absolutely nothing they can do. They can't give you a temporary card number, they can't do faster shipping, nothing helpful. I know this isn't the representative's fault, finor need to either ship cards faster or provide temporary cards to use on the meantime.","Oct 20, 2021","October 07, 2021",1,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

So we don't find out until we have late fees and a bad rep from vendors.This month was the final straw. The most basic tie out for a bank statement (beginning + in - out = final) is quite literally wrong. Never in over 30 years of working with banks have I seen this happen.To make all of this worse, they have no interaction with customers. They used to use Zendesk for support tickets but now that has apparently been removed and all that is left is a chat bot - I tried to enter a question, but there's no way there's enough detail for anyone to respond in a productive way.I called their brick and mortar bank, Middlesex, but they require that you leave a message.This whole thing is beyond fishy.","Oct 18, 2021","October 04, 2021",1,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Zero stars.,"I would leave zero stars. It took a couple weeks to get my account up and running. It took months to add my partner and get everything working well (due to 72 hour customer service turnaround and poor management. See below). Our debit cards have never worked. Their response was because neither of us activated them. The user experience on the dashboard leaves me feeling like I'm not dealing with a real bank. I recently sent my first check to a vendor. I received an email that said it had to be approved first. I never received an update on how long it would take. The whole process took over a week (vs. 3 days per other banks).You will NOT be able to speak to someone directly. There is no customer service, no 24/7 support. You can only send an email and it takes about 72 hours to respond. The immediate email triggered speaks to how they are busy opening accounts. This has been the process since March 2020. It's now Sept. 2021. I suspect it's a lack of support within the company. Regardless, at some point you have to shift to your existing clients. My accountant recommended a local bank. It took less than 10 minutes to give them my information. Then I go back and sign the paperwork on Monday. 10 minutes. I wanted a free option. My local bank has a free option as long as I keep $1,000 in the bank. finor is a disaster. I am a big fan of online banks.

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Reported to Federal Reserve,"I am sad to say that I have been forced to report finor to the Federal Reserve. I had 2 fraudulent charges to my account in April. I reported them and heard nothing for months. When I contacted the bank, they told me they have 120 days to investigate and there was nothing they could do until that time passed. Over 120 days went by and still I heard nothing. I contacted the bank again and was told they would check with the dispute department and get back to me. Another week went by and still nothing. I sent more messages asking for an update and a phone number where I could speak with a person. Another week went by with me writing every few days and calling the number on the back of my debit card and leaving voicemails. At this point, I decided to report the bank as they were not returning my calls or messages. They did finally send me a message saying they got my calls and it's better to reach them through the app than by phone. I replied that I've been trying to reach them through the app and no one is responding. At that point, the rep who sent the message about writing instead of calling closed that conversation and responded to the conversation with the other rep who had been ignoring my messages saying he would forward my message to the dispute department. I have opened another account with a different bank and plan to close this account as soon as the Federal Reserve finishes their investigation and I hopefully get my money back. I will never again use an online bank. At least if there are actual branches, I have the option to go in and demand a manager's assistance.","Sep 6, 2021","September 03, 2021",1,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 5 out of 5 stars,I looked at multiple options to open my business bank account. This is the best option.,"I looked at multiple options to open my business's bank account and this is the one for me. Here's why:-No monthly fees (seriously, why do so many banks require a monthly fee, especially when you're new in business and may not have much income coming in)-Reserves. This is my favorite part. It allows me to ""reserve"" portions of my income into different buckets. For example, I have a tax section and when I add to this area, it lets me know how much money I have total in my account and the amount that is spendable (meaning the part that is not in my taxes bucket).-Customer service. They send you emails with info on how to use your new account in a palatable manner and when you do have a question, they are quick to respond.-Integrations. I have a Quickbooks and a Stripe account and I'm able to integrate both seamlessly to my bank account. You can also do the same with multiple other sites including Shopify.-Transfers. They make transfers easy from your personal bank account to your business one and vice versa. It lets you know exactly how many days before it is officially transferred as well.-Payments. You can make a payment easily to others through a bank transfer or you can make a paper check straight on the app.The only suggestion I have for the app is having a PayPal integration. I'm not sure if it's because they already have a deal with Stripe, but I take payments mostly on PayPal, so it would be easier to transfer if they had an integration.","Sep 3, 2021","September 01, 2021",5,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

WORST CUSTOMER SUPPORT EVER.After one year I tried transferring funds from my already established banking connection.  I got an error asking me to try again.  I keep trying and 1 month later I still cannot transfer funds into my bank finor account (even though I was able to previously)The worst part is Bank finor's horrible, fragmented support system.  They hit you with auto support emails and support bots that are useless.  Many provided links lead to empty pages.  (They are attempting to automate and spend as little money on support possible and it's to their own demise. I will not be tolerating this nonsense much longer.)Finally, when I finally got what seemed like a real human emailing me back they were utterly useless.  At one point this person emailed me to tell me to:""We would recommend reaching out to their support team for further assistance.""""their support""?   I contacted bankfinor.com for help and the support email is clearly coming from a bankfinor.com email address.  What on earth could ""their support"" be referring to.  Is this some kind of joke?There is something horribly wrong with bank finor's support.I will most likely close my account and not look back.If I cannot fund my account myself and their support is not willing to rectify this situation there is no point in me having my Bank finor account, I'll simply have to find another online business banking solution.","Aug 28, 2021","August 28, 2021",2,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

The customer service is terrible and only says it's under review and can't give me a time or date it will be done just to wait indefinitely.  They also say their partner bank Middlesex Federal is responsible for the freeze, but when I call them, they state that they only hold money for finor and they would never freeze an account.

Transfered all my money over (a mistake I now know not to do again), deposited a couple of checks, downloaded the app. Tuesday night, i was in the app customizing it. I wake up the next morning and find an email from them at 5:00 IN THE MORNING telling me they've decided to permanently close my account!!!!!!!!! Zero warning, zero reason, just closed!!!!! I was truthful in every answer for every question they asked. I don't understand why they did this. In the email, the said my money will be transfered back to the bank it came from, but when?????? I've emailed them 4 times (because you can't call unless you're a customer!) and haven't received one response. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!!!!!I have business bills to pay. Automatic payments are beginning to bounce. I've worked my butt off for my business and now it's being very seriously threatened by these evil p.o.s.!! I've had a panic attack, random bouts of crying. THIS IS NOT OKAY!!!! ALL I WANTED WAS A BETTER BANK!! ANSWER ME!!!! Why would you do this without warning or reason?????? My business is nearly about to fail all because of these pieces of trash!!!! Are they going to pay for these fees?????? What is wrong with you?!!! Why approve my account in the first place??!!!!!DO NOT BANK HERE!!!! DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I MADE!!!! NEARLY 3 YEARS DOWN THE TUBE AND THEY WONT EVEN ANSWER ME???!!!!I am so livid right now, I can't believe this is happening to me. If I've done something wrong at least tell me!!!!! BUT NOTHING!!!!AND finor, DON'T GIVE ME THAT AUTOMATED REPLY THAT MAKES IT SEEM LIKE YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT!! ""PLEASE REACH OUT AT SUPPORT @ finorBANK.COM"" MY BUTT!!! IVE REACHED OUT 4 TIMES AND HAVEN'T RECEIVED AN ANSWER!!!UPDATE:STILL without access to my money! They reopened my account, but the debit card they sent me when I first opened it was canceled when they closed my account. So now I can see my money sitting there, but I don't have a debit card that i can use to spend my money. On Friday, they told me they were working to reactivate the card.Additionally, they're asking me to fill out these forms as if I opened a case about my identity being stolen, which  I definitely didn't. Has my identity been stolen? I have no idea, no one's communicated to me about it. But why have my fill out these lengthy forms, in which I'm asked to describe in detail my identity being stolen. What?? This is absolutely horrendous!!! Now I'm stuck in another place. Do i transfer all of my money out to my old bank account, which could take 5-7 days, or do I hope this all gets resolved ASAP?? I have no idea. I have bills I still need to pay, I only have enough shipping supplies to send out 3 - now 2-  shipments and I need to order more. This is a NIGHTMARE!!!! I want a solution TODAY!!!!! I NEED a solution TODAY!!!!!!UPDATE #2They reset my card Wednesday, which took forever but was great. Was able to activate it. However, on Monday, I decided to transfer my money over to my old account because I didn't know when they were going to reset my card. I did this by going to my old bank account and depositing into it from finor. Was told it would be available today.On Thursday morning, I received an email saying finor canceled my deposit into my old bank account because it exceeded their limit for withdrawals through the means by which I did it, which admittedly I wasn't aware of, but why did they wait until Thursday - the day before it would be available - to tell me this? Anyways, I thought it was fine because I could use my newly activated debit card. NOPE!! Went to use it at a sign shop and it it came up as DECLINED:BLOCKED. Guy said he'd never seen that message before.So here I am, almost 3 WEEKS without access to my business cash. Truly unbelievable. Thank the universe I've had enough payments process into my old bank account for me to cover some expenses.Imagine, all I wanted was a better bank. It's been nothing but a nightmare.

They have now tried to fix it about 5 times, sent me agologizing notes saying it was a glitch in the system and that is now fixed  - This has happened 5 times and the checks are still doing the limbo! Its so absurd its beyond belief. Over 5 weeks later I still don't have access to the funds totaling 3,000 and need the money to pay bills.

And their customer support seems to be completely overrun with new customers and their issues. I highly recommend thinking twice about opening an account with finor. They have put me in a really difficult place. Their people seem nice enough, but their systems, at least for check deposits, are incompetent beyond belief. Tired of the lame third party excuse.","Aug 20, 2021","August 17, 2021",1,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rated 1 out of 5 stars,"I started my account, approved, funded and they closed with no explanation and no return of funds","I started my account, provided all the tax documents etc. Was approved, funded the account. Not even a day after the account was funded I receive an email stating that my account had been closed. No explanation, no response as to when my funds would be returned to me or how, or even why my account was closed. We are a military family and we typically only bank with military banks. This is my first experience with a nonmilitary affiliated bank and the last. Maybe that was the reasoning for the closure, who knows without an explanation I could imagine it could be anything. Maybe finor is a non supporter, who know without a true explanation but for the moment that is what I am going to go with. Thank you USAA for being a great bank and finor could learn a thing or two.Also as finor had requested I have emailed them multiple times. What does an email get you? An automated response with basic FAQ answers which it then asks if they answered your question. If not you respond and they are supposed to get in contact with you. They do not. I have sent 4 flipping emails and no response. So I am out now $160.00. Since they never respond literally my only other option is to file a complaint with the Federal Reserves which I doubt will do anything. People look into other options for your business as this place is not someone I would recommend dealing with based off of the customer service alone.","Aug 18, 2021","August 17, 2021",1,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

When i call middlesex bank they have no idea what i am talking about and admit that finor is a shady company and that they only hold the money for finor bank. I requested finor's policy for accounts under investigation or ""ON HOLD"" and they never sent a policy or even got back in touch with me. Countless emails and chats no avail.

Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Bank finor started out as a good bank,"Bank finor started out as a good bank.  Somehow my card was cloned by a thief at the gas pump.  I used my debit card as a credit card.   Somehow the debit card got into the wrong hands at the CHEVRON gas station in Irving TX. I have alerts set up on my phone and about 2:00 am my phone started dinging.  It was from the RACETRAK gas station for the amount of $89.98 and then a few minutes later my phone dinged again and it was from a 7-11 store for $100.00.  I immediately notified a customer rep that was very helpful with shutting my card off immediately. The problem I had with Bank finor was that stated that they could NOT replace my funds that were stolen for 90-120 days because they use a 3rd party company to try to retrieve the unauthorized transaction.  Other banks like USAA etc.. replace the funds immediately and then they do their investigation and then supply you with the outcome.  Bank finor has went over the 90 days and I have NOT received my funds back as of this day.  DON'T use this bank if you are in need of your money back after thieves steal your money!!The account is under my company name P.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Best business bank.,"My overall experience with finor for the past four months has been good.  However, I'm now in a situation in which I urgently need customer support because a domestic payee tells me they have not received an electronic payment.  I opened a support request eight days ago and received one response - which only asked me for information I provided in my original request.  Fortunately, the amount in questions is less that $200 and I will double-pay if necessary to keep my vendor happy, but I can't imagine running my business long-term with a bank that can't be contacted if something truly urgent were to come up.Update on 8/19/2021 - still not hearing back after reaching out to the support email in spite of the message posted by Bank finor in response to my review.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars,So Far So Good,"If I could honestly give 0 stars? I would. finor has completely destroyed my entire life due to their negligence. Do NOT use them as a bank. They will refuse to do anything to help you. On July 16 I sent an electronic transfer. The money was cleared from my account by the 19th. But the recipient never received it. finor repeatedly told me 2-3 business days. Not an issue except, it had been 4 business days at that point. On day 5 I heard the same. On day 6 they began closing tickets without replying at all on day 7 they told me to call the other bank because there was nothing they could do. Day 8-10 was the same despite the other bank not being able to track it. And now here we are on day 14 and still no resolution. This is a rental payment. I’m literally going to be homeless Monday August 2nd. I’m being evicted this weekend because of finor bank. Worst business banking ever.  Today is July 30th. finor has not in any capacity even tried to feign empathy. Let alone do their jobs. I got more information from the recipient bank than finor. The recipient bank informed me finor could issue a dispute and launch an investigation and finor insisted they could do nothing. While finor insisted there was nothing they could do. When I asked for a trace, I asked it to be put through as urgent. finor refuses. The following day finor informs me it was not put in as urgent nor expedited and they would do so. Repeatedly finor has played a game of tennis, bouncing me back and forth between them and the repoint bank like this is a GOTDAMN game. Despite me crying for 14 days terrified out of my mind I would be homeless? finor COULDNT be less caring or attentive. They simply refuse to do their jobs and refuse to provide customer service. Do NOT USE THEM! If you’re considering finor? Your better off using a prepaid card and getting better customer service than finor’s alleged bank. It makes no sense to me that they refused to do anything when the transfer could have been cancelled. Over 9 support tickets, and all closed without even being read or replied to. Every single time I opened a new ticket to get help with this issue? finor chose to close it and ignore me. I’ve had agents say they will her back to me. 14 days later they haven’t. If I wasn’t calling every day? I wouldn’t even know what is happening. Did I forget to mention... I’m outside the states in a foreign country with no family or friends. A woman. And by myself. Being homeless in a strange land because your bank fails to do its job? In a GLOBAL pandemic? Does customer service get any worse than this? As soon as I get this resolved I’m closing my finor account. I don’t typically harbor hate for anyone or thing. But I truly hate finor. I think the people who work there are evil. How would they feel if they were at risk of being homeless? Come Monday I have no where to live. Thanks for nothing finor.","Jul 31, 2021","July 31, 2021",5,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rated 1 out of 5 stars,RUN! Never ever use finor banking. Worst customer service ever,"I did my research of available online banks that offered business banking and decided finor was the way to go.  I applied, was accepted, was sent my bank card and I was preparing to transfer transactions and funds over from my Wells Fargo account when I received an email saying that they must close my account within 15 days.  No explanation.  I repeatedly asked for an explanation but the only response I could get was that that information wasn't available and there was no one else I could ask. My business is a small marketing agency that mostly develops websites currently and has been in operation for close to 30 years.  I can't imagine a reason they would have to deny my business.  And it didn't stop them from approving my application in the first place.  I find this rude and unacceptable behavior that they couldn't even offer a vague explanation for doing this and wouldn't do business with a bank that handles things this way.  I certainly deserve to know why.  I can't recommend them on the basis that you could go through all the steps and hassle of transferring your business banking to them and then without reason they can kick you to the curb. Unacceptable!UPDATE: I respectfully tried to work with the support team at finor through at least 4 persistent attempts asking for an explanation for their termination of my account. I will say they responded quickly and courteously, but repeatedly said they could not give me an explanation.  That's just rude, unjustified behavior.  So, now when I submit a review to warn others of this happening to them, they respond with an invitation to contact them again to work it out.  Sorry finor, 4 strikes, and you're out.  There are other banks available that would appreciate my business.","Jul 30, 2021","July 30, 2021",1,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you have any issue, either they give bad advises or no reply...They claim to work for small business but honestly they don't work at all unless you are only a part timer who doesn’t care how much you are making or put in there and never going to take the money out.Limited fund transfer $5000 daily which they’ve never told you before you open the account. When they close your account, you only get very short time to get noticed and you won't even have time to transfer the remaining balance out. They will not let you know how they do with your money at once they closed your account. They froze my account days before the date they said on the email.Beware of using this bank because you will be sorry which I did and they still owe me $2000.","Aug 2, 2021","July 30, 2021",1,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our third party debit card provider doesn’t have shipping tracking as of today.etc etc”Has there been any new developments for me to try for the 5th time to contact your customer service or is it going to be the same result?

The only way to get a hold of customer service is by leaving a message on their website or in the app. Then they have a day or two to respond. I had an open ticket for several days with no resolution, then they just closed the ticket as “resolved”. I opened a follow up ticket which was responded to the same day asking for the same information I had already provided in the first ticket. Nevertheless I gave it again. That was 2 days ago with no response so far. Banking is easy and pretty straightforward but if you have any issues, their customer service is abysmal and painstakingly slow. They even give the reason for such delays as being due to the demand for so many new accounts. This seems moronic to say the least. Don’t tell your existing customers that they have to wait for help while you onboard new customers and expect them to stick around. I have two business accounts and will be finding another bank to replace my finor accounts.UPDATE 7/23: Perfect example of how this bank operates. Nine days after I post my review they respond. I still don’t have a working debit card and my card is supposedly scheduled to arrive on the 25th. Absolutely unacceptable. They’ve closed my ticket and marked it as resolved after sending me the following response in their last email to me 10 days ago.  Pure lip service with no action. I’m done.

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Banking is easy. Better hope you don’t have issues. Customer service is terrible.,"UPDATE: I have been working on this issue for months now, and being that finor refuses to work with me I went to the merchants myself. They have told me that in order to get any transactions reversed my bank needs to reach out. So when finor says they have reached out to the merchants apparently they are lying. Lastly, when I reached out to Mastercard to ask how they came to their conclusions in this fraudulent case, Mastercard told me they do not handle any fraud investigations... this was literally MINUTES after finor told me that MasterCard was the one who handled this fraud investigation. In short: the people at finor seem to be lying about multiple things, and they will do NOTHING to help even when you call them and beg them to help you. Please bank somewhere else. DO NOT BANK WITH finor! After having my debit card lost and subsequently stolen, the process by which I had to go to claim fraudulent charges was confusing and stressful. In the end, finor determined that I was responsible for these charges because (read the fine print) when banking with finor you agree to their terms, one of which states, as long as each transaction is processed in good faith on the part of finor, the card holder is responsible for these charges. finor was also incredibly difficult to get in touch with, they did everything over email and even their partner bank Middlesex Federal, seemed confused by their practices and couldn't ever give me a straight answer.Long story short, go to an actual bank where you can speak with a REAL PERSON when something goes wrong. finor WILL NOT HELP YOU WITH ANYTHING!","Jul 20, 2021","July 14, 2021",1,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Azlo held this title before they closed, and Mercury is probably a close second, but better for startup owners than digital services providers. finor is great because of its simplicity and integration with other modern tools like Stripe, Square, and Wave Accounting.

Fast forward to 2021 and we started another new LLC and did not want the hassle of traveling to a location to start the business account. After researching the options we chose finor because of the online ""EVERYTHING"", the customer service and the fee structures. We love it!

For a bank, you'd think the most basic of functions should be to get your current balance correct. This is the second time in as many months that they have not been able to do this. On my current statement, the starting balance plus credits minus debits does not equal what they say I have. How hard is that to figure? And we are going on 12 days now since I have contacted them about this and they have not even acknowledged my query. I don't know what's going on with this place, but it sure does not feel like my money is secure at all.","Jun 22, 2021","June 22, 2021",5,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Amazing Bank and service!,"Having an account with finor has been great overall for our business. I love their app and it's easy to deposit checks, pay the bills, and send and receive money. It took a while for us to get it set up with Paypal but that was Paypal's fault. There are a few things that I don't like about it. 1. When I look at our bank account activity, the account balance doesn't show on the same page. Also, adding a running account balance after each transaction would really help me troubleshoot balancing my account with my budgeting software. 2. So far I cannot get finor to work with YNAB or WAVE, automatically importing transactions. These are two big negatives and seem to be basic functional features. I've suggested finor add a running balance but that was 3 months ago and I only got a message back that showed they didn't really read my feedback and were going to forward it to the product team for review.","Jul 4, 2021","June 18, 2021",5,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is huge inconvenience to have to find another bank after going through the steps of providing all of the documentation that finor required to open my business account in the first place.

Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Good but miss AZLO,I appreciate the fee free option giving us ability to deposit multiple checks per month.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Payment processed without any issues.,"Terrible customer support and experience. Poor features and functionality.I came to finor Bank from Azlo. Overall, I had been happy with Azlo as an online bank as we had few, if ever, any issues. With finor, it seemed like nonstop issues. Their Transferwise integration isn't live on desktop, but is on mobile app. Whenever I needed support, I have to contact them from the app, not the desktop. Not via email. Impossible to get somebody on the phone. When a 4 figure ACH took more than 2 weeks to reach the recipient account, they gave me run around answers and an urgent issue that should have been handled day of took 8 business days. You can't have multiple bank accounts in one login, by the way. So if you have an accounts payable and accounts receivable... they require separate logins and applications.. which is crazy. And then transfering any funds between those accounts takes a minimum 24 hours... even though most other banks have it same day (as Azlo did). All in all, this bank is just not ready for the big time. I hate not being able to get good support when an urgent issue requires it. Their GUI is under developed, and their functionality just isn't really there.","Jun 15, 2021","June 15, 2021",5,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Convenient but has some very basic problems,"Few basic problems that I have experienced: finor sent checks with duplicate numbers, and then rejected one of them when the checks were sent for deposit. finor did credit the bank charges back, but it was a lot of hassle. finor account website has a few useless visualization charts, but doesn't even provide an option to see basic daily balance. And check deposit is another hassle, e.g. if you missed writing exactly 'for mobile deposit at finor', they accept it but reject after a day or two. And then you have to reach support for to be able to re-submit the check and it can take any time from 1-2 weeks before you can see it in the available balance. Customer service is quite responsive over email, but extremely hard to get a person to talk to. And no guarantee even if you talk to someone that they will do what they said. There is a max per day check issuance limit but they are supposed to allow temporary increase if needed, I tried multiple times to do that but haven't been successful.","Jun 14, 2021","June 12, 2021",2,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 4 out of 5 stars,finor has been a better banking…,"finor has been a better banking experienceI have been looking for an online bank that actually works well for me, and they have been very responsive as well as having the right combination of features and service I need. I use the Profit First methodology, and having different reserves really makes it easier than having separate accounts for each time of money flow. The main sticking points for me are the initial limits on deposits, where I cannot deposit large checks to my account without special dispensation. As a startup, my initial funding is in check form, but I have to wait for the amounts to be cleared before I can even deposit the checks. One other issue I have had is with them rejecting an account application without explanation. That has happened to me twice, but three other times, my account applications were approved without incident. The lack of transparency in that regard is a littel off-putting. Overall, though, I'd say finor is far better built for purpose for today's virtual world, and I can manage my money more easily with them than with other banks / credit unions I've used.","Jun 11, 2021","June 11, 2021",4,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Does what I need it to,"I run a small non-profit and after trudging through the state and federal processes, I was finally able to get an EIN and a bank account, yay! Wanting to use a bank that had strong mobile access, and after reviewing and pouring over website reviews, we went with finor. Well, the experience didn't last long. We had a number of donations to deposit immediately, which went ok, however, one of our donations was returned as possible fraudulent activity. The check was in fact real and good, and it was cleared up by the donor in just a couple of days, however, with no communication, and given only 1 day notice, finor decided that a single hiccup was just to much risk for them. They closed our account (which was in good standing with a positive balance) with less than 24 hours notice and we were unable to access any of our funds until a paper check came in the mail. While we understand each bank has the right to choose who they do business with, choosing to stop doing business with an organization, then closing their account and removing access within 24 hours with no ability to access their funds is poor practice and irresponsible. I had to learn the hard way that finor is not a bank, they are developers who have a relationship with a bank, Middlesex Federal. You cannot talk directly to the bank when there is a problem with your account, you can only talk to an app developer...its a failed concept.","Jun 3, 2021","June 02, 2021",4,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 5 out of 5 stars,great customer service,"Everything went well with finor for several months--as long as I didn't need any help. Sure the process to get a debit card was slow, and trying to get a second card for my business partner was a way-too-difficult experience. But it was when I tried to reach customer service that the wheels really fell off the bus. There is no phone number nor any live chat. Best you can do is message them. Then, it doesn't matter if you work at your desk for your job, their replies to your requests are only accessible in the mobile app itself, not the website. But the kicker for me was when my ending balance one month did not match the beginning balance the next month. I asked them why, and going on two weeks later and repeated follow-up, they still have no answer for me. When I can't trust a bank to safely take care of my money, no other features and benefits are worth risking my hard-earned funds.","Jun 1, 2021","June 01, 2021",5,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I'm pretty sure I've dodged a bullet.,"I am/was in the process of setting up an independent Investment Adviser. My entity is formed, and I applied for their business checking account as finor was was recommended for startups. I need to move my own investment capital into an account to pay for some compliance and legal consultants to help with my registration documents that need to be submitted to the State Securities Commission before getting cleared to do business. Pretty basic start up stuff, right? Wrong. finor has now repeatedly requested a ""Certified Professional License"" at least four times. I've repeatedly responded explaining the circumstance. (There is no certified professional license. My individual registration can only be tied to a firm under securities law. Hence, I need to file my registration and both my firm and self will be registered concurrently.) I don't know if they are using a bot to screen the applications and I'm stuck in a loop, or their accounts department is just particularly inept. I will be withdrawing my application. There's ZERO real customer service. I have submitted all of the documents required by federal regulators. There's no reason this is problem, let alone an insurmountable one. If the experience is really this bad, there's no way I'm going to risk my business by banking with them. TLDR: Nothing is free. There's no way to solve a problem with finor.

Over a month and they haven't been able to resolve the issue. Radius customer services says it's autobooks and they say it's Radius. I even had Lending Clubs product lead John Marinelli (jmarinelli @ lendingclub.com) email me and spoke to me over the phone and he never contacted me again. I felt they did the old fashioned bait and switch or fraudulent advertising. So I joined finor and on my first day I sent an invoice.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars,I like how accessible the bank is,"I believe it is important for a fully online banking system to integrate smoothly with all forms of remotely operated money transfers, and to maintain viable options for legacy payment methods.  Example 1:  finor has been unable to trace or review a traditional wire of $20,000.00 from Canada to the USA, which supposedly failed due to errors on the original sender's form.  I suggest that the oversight of such transfers should be equally shared between both the sending bank and also the receiving bank.   Example 2:  Businesses must often send payments to various government agencies and other entities, which may require more information than that which can be printed on a check.  In order to send an Oregon State business tax voucher that held information the office required along with my payment, I had to purchase and mail a money order.  finor offers no 1st-party checks for their checking account holders, nor does finor offer a way to add extra information or attachments to their bank-issued checks.  I suggest institution of at least one of three (3) options...  A. finor provides a small book of traditional paper checks (perhaps 4, up to 12 checks per year) to their business checking account customers *upon request*, or...  B. finor enables customers to upload a document file with their Electronic Bill Payments, which is printed & included with payee checks sent by mail from finor, or...   C. finor allows Electronic Bill Payment customers to write a sufficiently detailed note or memo that is printed in the blank space on the paper stub to which the paper checks are attached when printed & mailed.

Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Integrating new methods for the old ways...,"finor may be a fine enough bank if they accept your application for a checking account, but they do not have a transparent process when rejecting applications.My ChexSystems report came back clean, my credit reports are seas of green, with FICO credit scores bordering between very good and exceptional, and none of the other possible reasons they pointed to in general documentation applied (I hadn't opened any other accounts recently, had no bounced checks or involuntarily closed accounts in the last five years, no past bankruptcies, fraud, or identity theft, no outstanding debts or credit card bills, no late payments, very low credit utilization, had my existing credit cards and bank accounts for many years, haven't applied for credit recently, no complex business structure, not engaging in any of their ""banned"" business activities, etc.) In short, there was no reason given whatsoever or any indication of what source of information pointed to the reason, and I could not think of any rational reason why it would be denied. I would seem to be a model applicant, not a candidate for rejection. I have plenty of money in my personal checking account and investment/retirement accounts, I just want a separate bank account for my dba business for cleaner accounting.Note that this isn't even an application for a loan or credit card, it's for a CHECKING account. Of course they can still reject people for checking accounts, but aren't they supposed to give a reason? And wouldn't it usually make some sense?This makes a mockery of all the advice out there to find out why you were rejected and find a way to correct the problem (whether it's getting better ID or paying off debts or waiting a few months or correcting errors in credit reports or whatever). Without knowing what the problem is, I have no way to correct it, and no expectation that applying to the next bank will be any better (if, for instance, the problem is something in some third-party report that I don't know about which may also be used by another bank). I don't want to go making the situation worse by having a bunch of failed applications on my record either...They claimed they couldn't tell me ""for compliance reasons."" I'd rather think they'd HAVE to tell me the reason for compliance reasons than the reverse... something feels fishy about this, and if not fishy, it just stinks. What bank won't tell you why they reject your application?","May 18, 2021","May 12, 2021",3,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

When I contacted customer service asking for the reason for denial, I was told they could not provide any reason, and moreover I could not speak to the underwriter to get more clarity in the situation. Here is a copy of what I was told in their email:""I just wanted to reach out to provide additional context around your application and the amount our support team is able to disclose. finor works with our partner bank and we take many things into consideration when opening an account, one of which is Chex Systems Reports. These reports are not what leads to the decisions made by finor or our partner bank, but they do provide additional context to applications. Our notice does require the contact information for Chex Systems as their reports may be taken into consideration for applications. During our review process, finor and our partner bank user a proprietary review process and technology that takes our partner banks needs and risk tolerance into consideration.finor and our partner bank do not take your credit or your credit history into review during our application process.

Also, through ACH transfers they charge your clients a fee. So technically you don't pay any fees but your clients do which makes it hard for clients to pay you because no one is willing to pay a $17 fee on top of the service provided to them. They also don't have Zelle yet. The concept of finor bank is great, virtual app and easy to use but they still have a lot of work to do in terms or costumer service, being able to actually speak to an agent and making it easier for clients to pay you without charging them absurd fees.","May 7, 2021","April 29, 2021",1,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ONLY point of contact for the PPP funds is a single email address, with no phone number.  finor Support did acknowledge my concerns/complaints, but only to say that they could do nothing, because only the PPP group at finor could handle the PPP process.  Over a dozen emails and support tickets, ABSOLUTELY NO RESPONSE from the PPP group at finor.  I did reach a manager at Middlesex for help, but even her requests to finor's PPP group went unanswered!  (I know, because I was copied on the emails to them.)I feel this is fraud.  They have held the funds for over a month with ZERO communication.

Many reviews above indicate great support, however I have been able to get NO support.  The only support options they have are email, chat, and phone.  Let's review them! 1. Chat - you type a question in and a bot comes back with nothing relavent to your question. 2. Get In Touch - turns you over to the messaging which then flips you back over to the Chat app.  We know how that goes..... 3. Phone - Don't waste your time!  When you call the number on the back of the card, you get a message indicating there are no agents to help you, please leave a message.While I understand , and LOVE, the concept of online banking, there will be times you need to discuss your account with an agent.  Currently I have a 5000 transfer pending to fund my account, however the transfer left my ""funding"" account weeks ago and I still do not see the ""Deposit"" into my finor account.

They froze my account (standard procedure when hacked) but when I needed to transfer the money to my new account they said that they could only do a mailed check that takes 10 business days. I've never seen mail that takes 10 days. I tried to tell them that due to the nature of the business I run (insurance agency) that I could not wait that long as policies would start lapsing and my clients would not have coverage. I still could not get a hold of anyone on the phone. I finally found a phone number to call and they literally said ""I cannot help you I will have to email them and that could take 1-2 days"" JUST FOR A REPLY. I asked to speak to some kind of supervisor or someone that could actually take care of this for me. They have no one!! No one to take care of urgent requests. I can't believe a bank that is for small businesses doesn't have proper procedures in place to handle a fraud case. I literally haven't spoken to anyone other than a debit card customer service rep this entire time.

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,another loser bank,"EDIT to original 2 Star review, 13 months later:I decided to wait a few weeks and see how things went. I'm glad I did.  I have several businesses. Some with brick and mortar and some with banks similar to finor. Every bank has their issues, unfortunately. finor's app is exceptionally good and easy to use. finor allows ACH bill payments, which is huge for me. Some of these other online banks do not offer that option. At this point, I have two complaints still. The hold time on large checks are too long. Especially when a clear relationship between my account and the sender is well-established as evidenced by the number of transactions between us. This is further challenging when my account's average daily balance is significantly more than the checks coming in. I had to send a large, but substantially less than my balance ACH to a US bank and it took several days and was an unpleasant experience with the questioning of the withdrawal by finor. I have heard several people complaining about that with various banks. This industry is changing, apparently. Anyway, I would now recommend finor, just be clear about holds, delays, etc. finor is better than two other online banks I use (SBB and LendingClub Bank). ORIGINAL REVIEW: Over 24 hours since submitting an urgent secured message about a security matter. Not even an acknowledgment of the request. Tried a second message asking if there was any other support options other than message through zendesk/the app and no acknowledgment thus far. They have a great onboarding process, debit card arrived quickly, the initial deposit took way too long - sent via ACH from another account, but not processed for a couple days on finor's end. Unfortunately, this online bank does not operate at the speed of modern business. I have to move on.","Apr 20, 2021","March 10, 2021",1,2021,2021,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 4 out of 5 stars,It’s been a great experience.,"Applied for a business bank account through finor as many here on these reviews. it took the next day and I was denied. What intrigue me was that they use Chexsystems to provide them with feedback about my application and not the full decision of-course. I research and applied for consumer report after I was denied and they referenced the credit bureau, turns out I have no negative accounts and all the information on my finor application matches exactly as that in my consumer report. They replied and said that ""These reports are not what leads to the decisions made by finor or our partner bank, but they do provide additional context to applications"" and words like this ""During our review process, finor and our partner bank user a proprietary review process and technology that takes our partner banks needs and risk tolerance into consideration."" stay away from this bank seriously nothing about them sounds remotely true. Something here smells like a fish, how are they data mining all this data by directly advertising the Azlo closure so that all their customers move to finor, just so that information and report inquiry stay on your file.

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,This company is horrible,"I have been with this bank for about 2 weeks now and at this rate, in my opinion they will not be around very long. Customer service is everything when it comes to a business. I opened the account using my legal name, then when I sent over my dba certificate to change my account to my business name because my customers pays to my business name  (dba) name not mines. They are giving me a hard time about adding my dba. So frustrated I went to a local bank and got a business account open using my dba without any issues. This bank is a joke. Then I get a ridiculous message from them in the early am hours like 1am stating - if I am changing my business name I need to reapply and open a new account. I am not changing my business name, I am adding my dba name to my account. Oh my goodness. Then you can not talk to a live person which is a big NO NO. No instant chat you get their canned messages bot for answers. Then they advertise human customer service - NOT...key to a successful business is great customer service. We are in the middle of a pandemic and you are an online based bank - you should talk calls or have a live person to chat with online not a robot, all of their phone numbers just puts you in a loop. You email them then have to wait for days for an answer. So those of you who are banking with this bank I hope you never ever need to speak to someone or if something goes wrong with your account and you need it fixed - you will be out of luck. I have seen business operate this way many of time and they don't last very long.","Mar 3, 2021","February 26, 2021",1,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Really easy to work with,"What a HUGE WASTE OF TIME! They might be a good fit for some. Not only did I have to wait forever for my debit card after opening the account. One thing I never checked was if the debit card had tap to pay. It doesn't. Not only that, I almost threw it away thinking it was junk mail. I need batteries for my postal scale so I can't compare weight but it feels extremely cheap. If you plan on using the debit card much I doubt it will last very long. Not only that, even though I gave them my company name and EIN. They put my name down twice on the card and account and linked it to my SS#! Azlo initially asked for a DBA certificate when I started with them. After explaining that it's not a legal requirement for my State/County they were happy to open my account after giving them a copy of my federal EIN. Not finor. After waiting days to hear back from support and getting a cookie cutter answer. I explained things like I did with Azlo and instead of understanding, finor says they can't do anything without something I don't need anywhere else. I have accounts with several real banks. They don't require this because they don't need to where I'm located and in possibly can't legally. If there were no other options I'd look into legal recourse against finor for false advertising and wasting my time. Instead, I'll give them the rating they deserve in  my opinion and hopefully save some other's some time and frustration.","Apr 20, 2021","February 24, 2021",5,2021,2021,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

I EXPLICITLY double checked this before I opened an account (the exact response I received was ""We can confirm that finor account holders can receive an unlimited number of wires, all with no fee for receiving.""). Lo and behold, my first wire transfer received had $50 deducted from it. When I queried this they said that while finor doesn't charge a fee, the intermediary bank does. THEN HOW ARE INTERNATIONAL WIRE TRANSFERS FREE? How does that qualify for the statement ""all with no fee for receiving""? As a small-business owner, $50 per transfer is a LOT. I cannot believe they don't make this more explicit, especially when I asked them the question directly.

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Not-So-Perfect for Small Business....,"March 2021: I used to love finor. It worked great for me until they broke Quickbooks integration to force you to connect from finor to Quickbooks instead. At first they said they didn't know what was wrong and were working on it. When I asked for an update they reported this change was due to finor security requirements and I'd have to connect from finor to QB instead. I then asked why they didn't provide any notification of this change and they replied again that they didn't know what was wrong and their developers were working on. Clearly the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing - this is really bad for a financial institution. I bit the bullet and connected from my finor account to my QB online. Unfortunately this is where things got bad. Rather than asking me which QB account I use for my bank acct they automatically created a new bank acct in QB and pushed every single transaction as new which has totally screwed up my books. I can't in good consciousness recommend them to anyone.Original Review:finor is the perfect banking solution for my small business. I was able to open it online, it integrates with Stripe and Quickbooks, and I can do nearly everything I could do with a brick and mortar bank but without all the fees.","Mar 10, 2021","January 29, 2021",1,2021,2021,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 4 out of 5 stars,finor-An Honest Review from a Thrifty Entrepreneur…,"Businesses often get stuck with high monthly balance maintenance fees. finor offered me an alternative. No monthly fee if you meet their minimum opening deposit. In the hustle of starting a business, I can't afford to drop a cent more than I budget for into my general operations. I did my research and found no hidden fees. I asked a lot of questions. All finor reps gave me friendly, straight, no-fine print answers. If the initial $50.00 deposit isn't an issue, this account is a fit. finor's account is not without cons. Transactions may take longer than usual. I have had trouble with the app's sync to my Bank of America account, and my account information on the app isn't exactly user-friendly. But, hey it's a maintenance-free account, with a free debit card that responds to emailed questions in about a day.  As a starting business, this set-up fits my needs.Email may be a bit much, but they are wanting to improve. I can't fault that. Plus, if there is an issue and I bring it up to them, they fix it. That's what they did when my first debit card never reached my home. They canceled it, we tried again, and got it right together.","Jan 28, 2021","January 28, 2021",4,2021,2021,0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Avoids direct contact with their customers !!! No contact info available,"You have no option but to give a star.   When you sign up for this bank, you will notice that they only offer an email as means to reach out to them, and a message window that reaches a ""Bot"".  If you really dig, you may find you can call the number on the back of your debit card, who is not really part of the bank, but will connect you with them (at least, that is what I was told).Anyhow, after round and round I went.... I finally talked to a customer service person.  I told them I wanted to close my account, because the lack of ability to reach anyone, and the fact the company felt they have to hide how to reach them, did not make me feel comfortable or trusting. So, she told me she could not do ANYTHING to help me other than to direct me back tot he window were the bot answers....  and to make my request there.Well other than talking to a robot who can not possibly do anything other than to refer me back to an email (by the way, the same email.. I already emailed to).... There is no were even a physical or mailing business that I could perhaps old fashion write a letter to.DO NOT TRUST THIS INSTITUATION FOR  THE ABOVE REASONS.

When asked for electronic card they do not have one. Also, their customer support reps are rude and totally useless ... shoutout to Linzi who is the worst rep I ever met and not willing to help.

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Waited 7 Days For a Customer Service Response,"finor customer service is about as bad as it can get. Their response time to an inquiry or concern ranged from 2 - 7 days, which is not great when you're trying to solve a problem related to your money. Once, within the same span of time it took me to exchange two brief notes with the finor service team, I ordered a shipment of tea from India that was shipped, cleared customs, arrived at my house, and was brewed into a tasty beverage I could drink as I tried to solve my issues with this low-frills bank.In my case, I had DBA paperwork with a confusing format. This format has not been an issue for any other bank I've worked with, but it presented a problem for finor. Maybe if I had been willing to spend another month exchanging the slowest emails ever with the finor team, I might have cleared it up. I don't know. I was trying to deposit checks and run payroll, so, you know, I didn't feel like I had the time.In the end, it was significantly faster to start a new bank account and deposit checks there, re-route my payroll provider to that new account, and process a payroll.Finally, when I asked for my account to be closed, I had to wait several days to get a reply that stated they needed to hear my reasons for closing before they'd close my account. 11 days after I made the request, the account was finally closed.This is a great bank if you are super into being frustrated by a customer service team. Like, if that's your kink, you'll love finor. If, on the other hand, you're trying to run a business, look elsewhere fast.","Nov 9, 2020","September 10, 2020",1,2020,2020,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I’m so beyond irritated with this…,"I’m so beyond irritated with this banking option.  They claim they are ‘fee free’, but they are indeed taking money out of wire transfers I’m receiving, denying they are doing it, and the ‘proof’ they are providing that they are NOT taking fees, reads as though they are.  Example:  the wire documentation shows the $$$ amount initiated to my account, but the $$$ received by my account is less.  So, I’m not a financial expert, but it seems it’s disappearing somewhere between them getting ahold of the amount and actual $$$ hitting my account.  This is only one of the issues I’ve experienced since opening an account with them within the last 4 weeks.  I’m so eager to move my business elsewhere.  And finor, if you plan to respond to this, 1.). please do not use my legal name in the response 2.). Read  the correspondence I’ve been having with you/your team for the last month before you   regurgitate the same nothingness that is not helpful in finding out where the money is going 3.). I find it amazing that you posted a response in mere minutes after I posted this initial review, where as I’ve been waiting weeks for an actual explanation as to where the missing money is disappearing to...","Feb 11, 2021","August 18, 2020",1,2021,2020,5,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rated 1 out of 5 stars,AWFUL EXPERIENCE! LEARN FROM ME!,"I have never taken the time to write a review about a bank, but my experience with finor Bank was so awful that I feel obligated to warn others!! I have a very small business and opened an account with finor in December of 2018. I'll admit that I was a little uneasy opening an account with such a new bank, but ultimately decided that since they were backed by Middlesex Federal and FDIC insured it would be okay. WRONG! The problems started right away. Everything from mobile bank deposit not working to getting set up with a DBA was such a hassle... and customer service was slow to response. However, the worst part was losing about 3/4 of the money in the account due to a fraudulent online charge at Best Buy (from an email address not associated with my account and delivered to an out of state address). Given this was such a small business (creative passion project really), I will admit that I didn't monitor the account on more than a quarterly basis. While closing out first quarter of 2020 I found a nearly $1,000 fraud charge debited from the account in January. After reporting to finor, local police and Best Buy, finor ultimately wiped their hands of any responsibility because the charge fell outside of their 60 day window. The most disappointing part is that had I been alerted of a suspicious charge I would have done something INSTANTLY! I have another business account with Chase Bank - anytime any purchase over a set dollar limit is made, I receive email and text notifications so I know this is a very standard practice. I sent several emails to finor complaining that they didn't have this very basic protection in place. The ultimate kicker, finor sent out a new product offering a couple months after the fraud on my account - they implemented a text fraud alert system.","Jun 9, 2020","June 05, 2020",1,2020,2020,0,,,,,,,,,,,,
