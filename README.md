# Intent-Analyzer-From-Reviews

## Description

Intent Analyzer From Reviews is a sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool designed to classify intents from textual reviews. By leveraging techniques such as LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic modeling and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization, this tool automates the analysis of customer feedback, providing actionable insights to facilitate decision-making processes. This project is essential for businesses aiming to understand customer sentiment and improve their services based on customer reviews.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. The dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` include:
- `NLTK`: For text preprocessing, tokenization, stopwords removal, and lemmatization.
- `Gensim`: For topic modeling with LDA.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning models and TF-IDF vectorization.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `pyLDAvis`: For visualizing LDA topic models.
- `imbalanced-learn`: For handling imbalanced datasets using techniques like SMOTE.



### Input Data

Prepare your dataset (`dataset.csv`) ensuring it contains the following columns:
- `Review text`: The textual review content.
- `rating`: The rating given by the customer.
- `rating title`: The title of the review.
- `Review date`: The date the review was posted.
- `Date of Experience`: The date of the customerâ€™s experience.
- `rating_procesed`: The processed rating after any necessary preprocessing.

### Running the Script

To run the script and analyze your dataset, use the following command:
```sh
python review_intent_analyzer.py --input dataset.csv --output new_dataset.csv
```
- Replace `dataset.csv` with the name of your input dataset file.
- Replace `new_dataset.csv` with the desired filename for the analyzed output dataset.

### Output Data

After running the script, the output file (`new_dataset.csv`) will contain the original columns along with the following additional columns:
- `tokens`: Tokenized words from the review text.
- `topic`: The topic identified from the review.
- `intent`: The classified intent based on the topic.
- `intent_number`: A numerical representation of the intent.


### Input Dataset

The input dataset must be in CSV format and should include the following columns:
- `Review text`
- `rating`
- `rating title`
- `Review date`
- `Date of Experience`
- `rating_procesed`

Ensure there are no missing values in the specified columns after preprocessing.

### Output Dataset

The output dataset, in EXCEL format, will include additional columns for tokens, topic, intent, and intent_number

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration
- Load the dataset using `pandas`.
- Explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
- Check for and handle any missing values.

### 2. Text Preprocessing
- **Tokenization**: Split the review text into individual words.
- **Stopwords Removal**: Remove common words that do not carry significant meaning (using NLTK stopwords).
- **Lemmatization**: Reduce words to their base or root form (using NLTK's WordNetLemmatizer).

### 3. Feature Extraction
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Convert the textual data into numerical vectors that represent the importance of words in the documents.

### 4. Topic Modeling
- **LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)**: Identify topics within the review texts using Gensim. This helps in understanding the main themes present in the reviews.

### 5. Intent Classification
- **Mapping Topics to Intents**: Use predefined mappings to classify topics into specific intents such as "Technical Issues", "Customer Support Experience", etc.
- **Random Forest Classifier**: Train a Random Forest model to predict intents based on the TF-IDF vectors. Random Forest is chosen for its robustness and ability to handle high-dimensional data.

### 6. Handling Imbalanced Data
- **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**: Used to balance the dataset by generating synthetic samples for the minority class.

### 7. Visualization
- **pyLDAvis**: Visualize the topics generated by LDA to gain deeper insights into the data.

### 8. Output Generation
- Save the processed dataset with additional columns indicating tokens, topics, intents, and intent numbers.

## Example

An example command to run the tool is:
```sh
python review_intent_analyzer.py --input dataset.csv --output new_dataset.csv
```

This command processes the input dataset (`dataset.csv`) and generates the output dataset (`new_dataset.csv`) with the additional columns for tokens, topic, intent, and intent_number.
